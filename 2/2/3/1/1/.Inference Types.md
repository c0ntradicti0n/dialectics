Inferences give structure to our logical reasoning, with types ranging from inductive, deductive to abductive grounding our cognition of the world. Inductive reasoning often begins with specific observations and trends, leading to broader generalizations or conclusions, while deductive inferences start with generalized principles and aim to apply them in specific situations. Abductive inference, comparatively, starts from an incomplete set of observations and leads to the most likely, yet tentative explanation.
