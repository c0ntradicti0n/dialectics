The distinction between induction and deduction constitutes a pivotal dual aspect in knowing and reasoning processes. Deduction starts with general principles and infers specific instances, while induction starts with specific instances and generalizes to broader principles. Deductive reasoning tends to be more certain, providing definitive answers, whereas inductive reasoning provides probable answers. As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes said: “From a drop of water, a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara," exemplifying inductive reasoning.
