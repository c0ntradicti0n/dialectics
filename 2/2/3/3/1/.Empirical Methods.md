Empirical methods draw from observable and measurable evidence to establish credible facts and theories. They adhere to the principles of scientific research, mostly relying on quantifiable data that can be tested for validity through statistical, mathematical, or computational techniques. Experimental and correlational research methods are examples of empirical methods commonly used in various fields. Louis Pasteur said, "Chance favors only the prepared mind," emphasizing the importance of empirical methods, as they often start with an open and prepared mind observing patterns in data.
