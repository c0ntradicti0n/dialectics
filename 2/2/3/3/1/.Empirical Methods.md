Empirical methods are research techniques that rely on observation and experimentation. These methods utilize data derived from actual observation or experimentation rather than theoretical or philosophical considerations. Empirical methods involve the collection of quantitative data, which is then statistically analyzed to reveal patterns, relationships, or trends. This approach is underpinned by the belief that knowledge should be based upon observable and measurable facts.
