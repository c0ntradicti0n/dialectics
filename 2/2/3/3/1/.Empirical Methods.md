[Empirical methods are](2/2/3/3/1/.Empirical%20Methods) [research techniques that](2/2/3/3/1/.Empirical%20Methods) [rely on observation](2/2/3/3/1/1/.Observation) and experimentation. These [methods utilize data](2/2/3/3/1/_Data-Theory) [derived from actual](1/1/3/2/1/.Derivation) [observation or experimentation](2/2/3/3/1/1/.Observation) [rather than theoretical](2/3/1/3/1/.Scientific%20Realism) or philosophical considerations. [Empirical methods involve](2/2/3/3/1/.Empirical%20Methods) [the collection of](1/1/3/3/2/3/2/.Collection) quantitative data, which [is then statistically](3/3/3/3/3/_Evidence-Probability) [analyzed to reveal](2/1/1/3/3/2/2/.Analyzing) patterns, relationships, or trends. This approach [is underpinned by](1/1/3/2/3/3/3/1/_Above-Below) [the belief that](2/2/3/3/3/1/.Belief) [knowledge should be](2/2/3/3/3/2/.Knowledge) [based upon observable](2/3/1/3/1/_Observable-Unobservable) and measurable facts.
