Rational methods involve reasoning, logic, and critical thinking. It begins with universally accepted premises to reach a logically certain conclusion. Purely rational observations, based on logical reasoning rather than factual observation, can lead to hypotheses and theories. Rationalism believes that certain truths exist and that the intellect can directly grasp these truths because it possesses an inherent ability to reason.
