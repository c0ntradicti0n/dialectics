Rational methods, in contrast to empirical methods, rely heavily on reasoning and logical inferences. They employ deduction, induction, and the systematic analysis of concepts and propositions. Philosophers like Descartes used rational methods, relying on a priori arguments and truths that can be known independent of sensory experience. Albert Einstein alluded to the rational method's importance in his quote: "The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination." The quote indicates that the mental construction of potentialities is a part of a rational method.
