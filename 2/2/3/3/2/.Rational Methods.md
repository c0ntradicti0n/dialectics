It [begins with universally](1/2/1/1/3/_All-encompassing) [accepted premises to](2/2/3/2/2/3/.Models%20of%20Justification%20) [reach a logically](3/3/1/3/1/1/2/.Logical%20Analysis) certain conclusion. Purely rational observations, based [on logical reasoning](2/2/3/3/2/2/.Logic) [rather than factual](2/1/3/2/2/2/1/.Fact) observation, can lead [to hypotheses and](3/2/1/1/1/1/.Hypothesis) theories. Rationalism believes [that certain truths](2/2/3/3/3/1/.Belief) [exist and that](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) [the intellect can](2/3/1/_Abundance%20of%20Knowledge) [directly grasp these](3/1/1/3/1/2/.Manipulation%20Robots) [truths because it](3/2/2/1/1/2/1/3/2/_Truth-Process) [possesses an inherent](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) ability to reason.
