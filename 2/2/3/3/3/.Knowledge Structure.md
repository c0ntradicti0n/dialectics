Knowledge structure pertains to how information is organized and interrelated in our minds or in scholarly fields. The structure reflects cognitive processes such as categorization and generalization and constitutes how we understand and make sense of the world around us. The knowledge structure is vital in learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Knowledge structures can range from hierarchies to webs of associations. The quote, "The map is not the territory," by Alfred Korzybski, epitomizes the idea of knowledge structures, highlighting the distinction between the representation and reality.
