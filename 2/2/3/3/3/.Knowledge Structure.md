Knowledge structure denotes how an individual organizes and represents knowledge. Cognitive psychologists associate it with mental models or cognitive maps. Knowledge structure is not a mere quantitative accumulation but an organization of information that also reflects qualitative aspects such as depth and complexity. More complex structures can include the comprehension of abstract principles and insights that knit many pieces of information into a coherent whole.
