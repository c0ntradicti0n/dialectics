[Truth approximation denotes](2/2/3/3/.Truth%20Approximation) [the process of](3/1/1/2/2/2/1/1/1/2/2/1/.Process) [approaching truth through](2/2/3/.Truth) [a combination of](1/1/3/3/2/.Combinations) [inductive and deductive](2/2/2/2/3/3/.Inductive%20Reasoning) reasoning. The dialectical [relationship between induction](2/2/3/3/_Induction-Deduction) [and deduction reveals](2/2/3/1/1/2/.Deductive) [the nuanced ways](1/1/3/3/1/3/3/.Approach) [in which knowledge](2/2/3/3/3/2/.Knowledge) is acquired, refined, [and improved over](3/1/1/1/1/2/1/3/3/_Renewed-Reused) time.
