Epistemology, the study of knowledge, questions what constitutes knowledge, its nature, and its limits. It grapples with issues of belief and justification exploring concepts such as truth, skepticism, and the methodologies of obtaining knowledge. To scrutinize the nature of knowledge, epistemologists classify it into a priori (knowledge gained independently of experience) and a posteriori (knowledge derived from experience) types. Derived forms of knowledge like scientific, are always conceptual, predominantly feature a posteriori, but some of the a priori.
