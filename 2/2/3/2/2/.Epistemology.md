Epistemology, the study of knowledge, questions what constitutes knowledge, its nature, and its limits. It [grapples with issues](3/1/1/3/1/2/2/.Pneumatic%20Grippers) [of belief and](2/2/3/3/3/1/.Belief) [justification exploring concepts](2/2/3/2/2/3/.Models%20of%20Justification%20) such as truth, skepticism, and the [methodologies of obtaining](2/3/1/2/1/.Scientific%20Method) knowledge. To scrutinize [the nature of](1/3/.Nature) knowledge, epistemologists classify [it into a](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) [priori (knowledge gained](1/_Synthetic%20a%20Priori) [independently of experience)](1/1/3/2/2/1/3/3/.Experience-based) [and a posteriori](2/2/2/3/1/1/1/.Modus%20Ponens) [(knowledge derived from](2/2/3/3/3/2/.Knowledge) experience) types. Derived [forms of knowledge](3/2/1/1/1/.Investigating) like scientific, are always conceptual, predominantly feature a posteriori, [but some of](1/3/1/2/2/3/1/2/.Kinds) the a priori.
