Epistemology explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. It is concerned with the reliability of our claims to knowledge, drawing from conceptual tools like belief, truth, justification, and doubt, considering how we know what we know, and defining the boundaries between true knowledge and mere belief or opinion.
