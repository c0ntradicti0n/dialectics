Metaphysics delves into fundamental notions such as existence, reality, causality, and freedom. It scrutinizes the nature and constitution of the universe dealing with its most basic and abstract elements. Questions it encompasses include, 'What is the nature of reality?' 'What is a person?' 'What is the connection between the mind and the body?' 'Do we have free will?' In analyzing these concepts, metaphysics seeks to reveal the underlying structure of reality.
