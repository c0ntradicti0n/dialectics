Metaphysics navigates the abstract principles of reality, encompassing the fundamental nature of being and the world that surrounds it. It engages in questions like, what is reality? What is the nature of existence, of time, of consciousness? This club of philosophy ponders over the ultimate nature of reality, beyond the physical or empirical realm.
