The scientific method is a systematic way of learning about the world that relies on empiricism â€“ the theory that knowledge is derived from sense experience. It utilizes observation and experimentation to explain natural phenomena. This process begins with the identification of a question or problem, which is followed by the generation of a hypothesis. Afterwards, an experimental design is created to test this assumption. Results from the experiment are analyzed and then conclusions are drawn.
