The scientific method represents the systematic procedures that scientists undertake to gain knowledge about the natural world. It involves observation, formulation of hypotheses, conducting experiments to test these hypotheses, and the analysis of results leading to conclusions that either support or disprove the initial hypothesis.

As Albert Einstein once said, "It is the systematic effort of the human mind to explore the unknown that the soul of the scientific methodology is anchored."
