In the dialectic between hypothesis and theory, a hypothesis is a speculative statement about the relationship between variables, which can be tested and disproved. When a hypothesis is repeatedly tested and not disproved, it may evolve into a theory: a systematic and generalized understanding of aspects of the natural world that is supported by a large body of evidence.
