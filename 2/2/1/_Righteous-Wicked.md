Obligation and choice form the crux of the dialectics between Duty and Restoration. An obligation can be seen as a constraint that limits our freedom of choice, demanding we act in accordance with certain norms, often in service of preserving and restoring the resources used and affected by our duties. On the other hand, choice symbolizes our free will, enabling us to decide our actions based on personal judgment or preference.
