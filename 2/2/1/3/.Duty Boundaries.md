The concept of duty forwards obligations or responsibilities an individual ought to fulfill. It introduces various boundaries to the breadth and depth of action, designating the limits of morality and ethics. Duty may arise from laws, societal norms, agreements, or personal conscience, governing the spaces for permissible action. Notably, responsibilities vary among different social contexts, and appropriate duty execution often involves intricate compromises among competing obligations. The encroachment upon or rejection of these set boundaries can lead to ethical dilemmas, raising questions about the freedom of choice and coercion within morality.
