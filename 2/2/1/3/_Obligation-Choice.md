[Obligation-Choice is the](2/2/1/3/1/_Obligation-Choice) [antinomic mutual relation](2/2/2/1/_Organic-Inorganic) between duty, principle, and law. It [involves an individual's](3/2/3/1/2/2/1/.Self-Ownership) [sense of responsibility](3/3/1/3/2/2/2/.Self-Determination) [(duty) set against](3/2/2/2/1/1/_Duty-Breach) [the code of](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/2/.Coding) [conduct established by](3/1/3/3/3/2/2/1/.Civil%20Law) society (principle), ultimately [subject to the](3/2/3/1/2/2/2/.Voluntary%20Exchange) legal implications (law). Here, one's obligation [is often in](1/2/1/1/3/3/.Ubiquitous) [tension with personal](3/3/2/2/1/3/1/.Conflict) choices, insinuating the [complicated relationship between](1/3/2/2/2/_Symbiotic-Parasitic%20Relationship) [the individual's internal](2/2/1/1/_Inner-Strength) [world and the](3/.Culture) external societal structure.
