Obligation-Choice is the antinomic mutual relation between duty, principle, and law. It involves an individual's sense of responsibility (duty) set against the code of conduct established by society (principle), ultimately subject to the legal implications (law). Here, one's obligation is often in tension with personal choices, insinuating the complicated relationship between the individual's internal world and the external societal structure.
