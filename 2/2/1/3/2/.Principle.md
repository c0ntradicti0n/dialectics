A principle is the fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behaviors or a chain of reasoning. It is the immutable present within the changing dynamics of situations, providing consistency amidst chaos. However, principles being absolute, may limit the flexibility of judgment and have the potential to clash with duties, pushing individuals towards creating laws in an attempt to reconcile the conflict.
