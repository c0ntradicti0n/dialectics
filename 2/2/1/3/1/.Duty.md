Duty is an ethical or moral obligation that compels action from the understanding of an individual. Although individuals often fulfill their responsibilities due to societal pressures or legal requirements, duty comes from personal conviction. It is the internal compass that drives a person to act in accordance with moral guidelines, navigating the complexities of social, economic, and political challenges. Yet, duty, being inherently subjective, may conflict with external norms and principles, causing tensions within the self and the collective.
