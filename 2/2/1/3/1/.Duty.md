Duty constitutes an obligation or a responsibility; a requirement of ethical or moral conduct that an individual is expected to fulfil. The concept centres on the ability of humans to operate within societal norms and guidelines, based on their own free will and reasoning. Duty drives compliance to laws, the performance of tasks, and the adherence to the ethical and moral standards applicable in one's personal and professional lives. It is the inner compulsion to do what is right, even if it seems against one's immediate interests. Being conceived out of the universal necessity of social cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem. cohabitation, Duty transcends the immediate utility and aims at a higher functional harmony of the societal ecosystem.
