Philosophical inquiry involves the critical examination of fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, ethics, and existence. It goes beyond empirical observation and experimentation to explore abstract concepts, values, and principles. Philosophical inquiry examines the nature of knowledge, the limits of human understanding, and ethical frameworks. It encourages reflection, conceptual analysis, and contemplation on the fundamental aspects of human existence and the world we inhabit.
