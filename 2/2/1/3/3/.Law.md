Laws are the systemic approach to harmonize duties with principles, converting the abstract concepts into tangible, actionable items. They form objective norms which are to be followed, considering both personal duties and collective principles, and ensuring they are in accordance with the welfare of the community. Moreover, laws iterate the loop of a dialectical system by forcing duties to reshape and refine themselves, and principles to readapt and maintain their relevance.
