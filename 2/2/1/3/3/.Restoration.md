Restoration refers to the process of bringing something back to its original, unaltered state or improving it to a condition better than before. It serves the dual purpose of rectifying the damage created by the misuse or overuse of resources and maintaining the sustainability of resources and duties over time. Restoration practices could range from reparation of a physical object, rehabilitation of ecological environments, or even recuperative efforts on a societal level, such as building social justice or striving for peace.
