Necessity is the synthesis of the a priori and a posteriori. It recognizes the integral role of both innate reasoning and empirical validation in forming a comprehensive understanding. Knowledge is not solely based on logical reasoning nor confined to sensory experience; instead, it is the necessary intertwining of both. Necessity underlines the importance of combining rational analysis with empirical confirmation to produce robust and reliable knowledge.
