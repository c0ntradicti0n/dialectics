[Satisfaction is the](2/2/1/2/2/.Satisfaction) [subjective judgement of](2/2/3/2/2/_Subjective-Objective%20Knowledge) success, grounded in [personal gratification and](2/2/1/2/2/.Satisfaction) intrinsic reward. It [stands as an](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/.Singular) antithesis to efficacy, [emphasizing quality over](3/1/3/3/1/2/1/1/3/.Quality%20Control) quantity, and valuing [the process over](3/1/1/2/2/2/1/1/1/2/2/1/.Process) the product. Yet, [the pursuit of](2/3/3/.Human%20Endeavors) [satisfaction may compromise](2/2/1/2/2/.Satisfaction) [the objective measure](2/3/1/2/3/.Measurement) of success.
