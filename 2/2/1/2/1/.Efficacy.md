Efficacy, as an [objective measure of](2/3/1/2/3/.Measurement) success, stands as [the thesis of](2/3/3/1/3/2/.Literature) assessing action outcomes. [It signifies the](3/1/1/2/1/1/_Signifier-Signified) [extent to which](2/3/1/3/1/3/.Limitation%20Boundaries) [desired outcomes are](1/1/3/3/3/3/.Outcome) achieved, focusing on [quantitative results and](2/3/1/2/3/_Qualitative-Quantitative) deliverables. However, efficacy, being outcome-based, may [risk overlooking the](2/1/2/3/2/2/.Risk%20Aversion) [value of the](3/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Thermocouples) process, potentially leading to undesired side-effects.
