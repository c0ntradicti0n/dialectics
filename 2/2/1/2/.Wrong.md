Wrong, as a counterpoint to right, signifies an action that infringes upon the rights of others. It posits that individual actions have limits and boundaries when they impede the rights of others, fostering conflict. However, the mere avoidance of wrong does not fully encapsulate justice, for justice implies not merely the absence of wrong, but the active promotion of right.
