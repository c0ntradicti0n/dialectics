Outcome metrics quantify ethical behavior, offering a measurable perspective on the impact and consequences of an individual's actions. Metrics may involve tangible outcomes such as the minimization of harm, preservation of resources, maximizing benefits, or the achievement of a specific goal. Equally important are intangible metrics like the increase of goodwill, happiness, understanding, and respect. The relativity of these metrics, however, foregrounds the inherent challenge in evaluating ethical conduct, especially when tangible and intangible metrics collide or exist in tension. Thus, the enmeshing of differing metrics underscores the necessity for ethical judgment in balancing these disparate outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes. outcomes.
