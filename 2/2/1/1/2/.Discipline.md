Discipline serves as the antithetic force to moral fiber, as a behavioral code that, though externally imposed, becomes internalized over time. It involves practices and regulations guiding one towards desired states of being and goals. Discipline, however, can limit personal freedoms, and foster blind compliance rather than nuanced understanding, much like an overly strict moral fiber does.
