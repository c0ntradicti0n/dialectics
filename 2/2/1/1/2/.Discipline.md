[Discipline serves as](2/2/1/1/2/.Discipline) [the antithetic force](2/1/2/2/_Attractive-Repulsive) to moral fiber, [as a behavioral](2/3/3/2/1/1/.Behavioral%20Economics) code that, though externally imposed, becomes internalized over time. [It involves practices](2/3/2/1/2/.Practices) [and regulations guiding](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/2/2/.Regulation) [one towards desired](1/1/3/1/1/_One-Many) [states of being](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/2/.State) and goals. Discipline, however, can limit personal freedoms, and [foster blind compliance](3/2/2/2/_Regulation-Indulgence) [rather than nuanced](3/3/2/2/3/3/.Themes%20and%20Interpretations) understanding, much like [an overly strict](3/1/3/3/3/3/3/_Restrictive-Permissive) moral fiber does.
