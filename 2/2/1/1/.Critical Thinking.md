Critical thinking is the cognitive process of analyzing and evaluating information objectively and independently. It involves actively questioning, challenging, and scrutinizing ideas, arguments, and evidence. Critical thinking enables individuals to make rational judgments and decisions based on logical reasoning, evidence, and a consideration of multiple perspectives. It serves as a powerful tool for discerning truth, detecting fallacies, and navigating complex issues.
