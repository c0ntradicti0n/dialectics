A proposition is an initial thesis, a declarative statement that can be either true or false, but never both. It serves as the starting point of logical reasoning, expressing a complete thought about a subject. The proposition, despite its apparent simplicity, is profound in its potential to be further developed and examined. It offers a raw, unrefined piece of information or claim that can be tested, verified, and potentially refuted, paving the way for an argument to be constructed around it.
