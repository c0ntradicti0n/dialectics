[Virtue qualities serve](2/2/1/1/.Virtue%20Qualities) [as guidance for](3/1/3/3/3/1/1/2/2/.Education) [ethical behavior and](2/2/1/3/1/2/.Ethical) actions. Virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance [were first posited](1/3/1/3/3/1/.Origin%20Theories) [by ancient philosophers](3/3/3/2/2/.Mythological%20Epics) [like Socrates and](3/3/3/3/2/1/1/2/_Enlightenment-Leadership) Aristotle, depicting an individual's moral character. These qualities, inherently [self-desirable and beneficial](1/3/1/3/3/1/_Beneficial-Detrimental) for the community, [underpin decision-making processes](3/2/3/1/3/3/2/_Decision-Implementation) [and nurture the](1/1/3/2/1/3/2/1/.Development) [development of a](1/1/3/2/1/3/2/1/.Development) virtuous character. Yet, [the interpretation of](2/2/3/2/1/3/.Interpretation) [virtue varies drastically](2/2/1/1/.Virtue%20Qualities) between individual, cultural, and societal contexts, [yielding a complex](3/3/3/1/1/1/_Simple-Complex) [web of moral](2/3/2/1/3/1/1/.Moral%20Virtues) [diversity and ethical](3/2/3/3/2/3/3/.Multiculturalism) multiplicity. Consequently, it [emphasizes the internal](2/1/1/3/_Internal-External%20Care) strength of character, [classifying virtuousness as](2/2/1/1/.Virtue%20Qualities) [an individual capability](3/3/1/3/2/2/1/.Autonomy) [to resist external](3/1/2/3/1/1/1/.External%20testing) [pressures while acting](1/3/1/2/3/1/3/1/2/.Pressure) morally.
