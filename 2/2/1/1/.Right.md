Right, in the context of legal ethics, is a normative principle expressing what is due to an individual within a societal framework. It affirms the fundamental dignity, freedom, and equality of all individuals. However, the absoluteness of right, if left unchecked, can lead to a conflict between individual rights and collective good, which hints towards the notion of wrong, an infringement upon another's rights.
