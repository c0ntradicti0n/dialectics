Aesthetics is an exploration of beauty and taste, whether it lies in the simplicity of form, or the intricacies of complexity entwined with functionality. An aesthetic experience is predominantly sensory, but is also intimately connected with emotion and thought, evoking responses ranging from pleasure and admiration to revulsion and disgust. It is through aesthetics that we appreciate the harmony in design and color, the pleasing rhythm of alternating patterns, the evocativeness of certain forms, and the resonance or dissonance they create within us. The sense of aesthetic pleasure can often be deeply personal, influenced by cultural, social, historical and individual factors, making it an element where fear and desire often intermesh, driving design choices within the human-made world.
