The concept of the sublime synthesizes the dialectic between beauty and ugliness. Unlike the inherent harmony of beauty or the apparent disharmony of ugliness, the sublime overwhelms and consumes, invoking a sense of awe and dread, as well as exhilaration. It transcends the binary of beauty and ugliness, instilling a deep sense of wonderment and insignificance in the face of a grandeur that is beyond comprehension. This awe-inspiring experience of the sublime captures the paradox of fear and desire, invoking simultaneous feelings of pleasure and terror, drawing us closer while repelling us at the same time.
