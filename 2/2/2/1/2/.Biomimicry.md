[Biomimicry is the](3/3/2/1/3/2/2/.Biomimicry) [principle of emulating](2/2/3/1/2/2/.Simulation) [nature's time-tested patterns](1/1/2/3/3/.Pattern) and strategies. It [brings valuable insights](3/1/3/3/1/2/1/3/3/.Insight) [into solving human](3/2/1/1/1/.Investigating) [problems by looking](2/1/1/3/3/2/2/.Analyzing) [at how nature](3/3/2/2/2/1/1/.Nature%20Cycles) manages similar challenges. Yet, biomimicry, appealing [to the principles](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) [that underlie the](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) natural world, may [induce tension with](3/1/1/1/1/1/2/1/2/_Tension-Release) [fractal patterns that](2/2/2/1/1/.Fractals) [inherently defy order](1/3/1/1/1/2/2/_Order-Disorder) [and predictability](2/3/1/3/1/2/.Predictive%20Utility)
