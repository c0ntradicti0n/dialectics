[The antinomic mutual](2/2/2/1/_Organic-Inorganic) [relation in this](3/1/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/_Tree-Relation) system, Organic-Inorganic, elucidates [the conflict and](3/3/2/2/1/3/1/.Conflict) [complementarity between living](2/2/2/1/_Organic-Inorganic) [biological organisms (organic)](1/3/1/3/1/2/.Organismic%20Biology) [and non-living entities](3/3/3/1/3/3/_Inanimate-Alive) (inorganic). Both contribute [to the intricacies](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [of our interconnected](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) environment, touching upon [myriad disciplines from](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) biomimicry to fractals, [ultimately striving for](3/3/1/3/2/2/2/.Self-Determination) balance.
