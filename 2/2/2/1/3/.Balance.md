Balance, in the dialecticism of biomimicry and fractals, signifies the equilibrium that exists in natural systems. It represents the idea that all elements and forces within a system contribute to maintain a state of harmony. Nevertheless, achieving balance is an ongoing process as elements evolve with time, demanding a constant coordination among functioning elements to maintain equilibrium.
