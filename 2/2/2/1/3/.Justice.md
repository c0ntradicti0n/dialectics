Justice, the synthesis of right and wrong, is the principle of fairness that harmonizes individual rights with the collective good. Justice reconciles the conflict between right and wrong, providing a mechanism to correct wrongs and uphold rights. It ensures the equitable distribution of rights, arbitrating conflicts, and seeking to balance individual freedom with collective welfare.
