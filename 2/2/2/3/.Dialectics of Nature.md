Dialectics of Nature refers to the application of dialectical philosophy to the natural world, where processes and phenomena are viewed as interconnected, changeable, and marked by contradiction and conflict. It treats nature as a dynamic, evolving system marked by interconnections and constant transformation, rejecting static or isolated perspectives. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of nature's phenomena, including its transformative and self-regulating capacities.
