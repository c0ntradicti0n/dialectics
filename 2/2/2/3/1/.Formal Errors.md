[These mistakes typically](2/2/2/3/2/.Informal%20Errors) [involve procedural flaws](2/1/3/2/2/3/.Procedural) [in the formation](1/1/3/3/1/2/3/.Formation) of an argument, [thus compromising its](1/1/3/2/1/1/3/1/.Unchangeability) soundness. While they [challenge our cognitive](2/1/3/3/1/3/.Cognitive) abilities, formal errors [also provide avenues](2/3/3/2/1/3/.Development%20Economics) [to refine and](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [develop our reasoning](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) abilities.
