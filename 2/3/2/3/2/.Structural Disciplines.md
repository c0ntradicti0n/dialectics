Structural disciplines encompass fields like architecture, engineering, and design, mirroring our intent and purpose articulated in concrete, material form. Conceptually bridging objective materiality and subjective creativity, structural disciplines imbue raw materials and empty spaces with function and meaning, creating a synthesis that straddles the realm of practical necessity and aesthetic transcendence. The harmonious coexistence of form and function presents an intriguing dialectic within these disciplines, often leading to awe-inspiring manifestations that bear witness to the ingenuity and aspiration of human creative spirit. To quote famous architect Frank Gehry,  "Architecture should speak of its time and place, but yearn for timelessness."
