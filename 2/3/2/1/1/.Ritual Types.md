Rituals types can range from communal to solitary, from birth to death, varying across different cultures and societies. These practices infuse daily life with meaning, linking people to their community and anchoring them in their beliefs, traditions, and history. Anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor once said, "A cultural ritual is a ceremonial act that carries with it symbolic significance beyond the act itself."
