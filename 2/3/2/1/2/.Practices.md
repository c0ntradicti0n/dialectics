Practices encompass specific cultural behaviors, whether they be everyday routines or special rites. These practices serve to imbue individual experience with cultural significance, reinforcing the shared values of a community. The practices may vary, but their core purpose remains the same, as anthropologist Ruth Benedict puts it, "The purpose of anthropology is to make the world safe for human differences."
