The relationship between the static and dynamic aspects of cultural traditions is always in flux. The static encompasses established customs and values, providing stability and continuity. The dynamic is the force of change, driven by societal evolutions, technological advancements, and individual innovations. It reflects an eternal tension constant in every civilisation, captured precisely in what Mahatma Gandhi said, "A nation's culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people."
