Values are the moral and ethical principles that guide individual and communal actions. These values are often embedded and reinforced through cultural traditions, practices, and rituals. They serve as a cultural compass, guiding members towards acceptable behaviors, decisions, and attitudes. As cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead stated, "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."
