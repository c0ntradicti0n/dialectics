Through traditions, the [wisdom and experiences](2/2/3/3/3/3/.Wisdom) [of previous generations](1/3/1/2/1/1/2/1/.Generations) [flow into the](1/3/1/1/1/1/2/2/_Thick-Thin%20Flow) present, providing a [structured frame of](1/2/1/1/_Structured-Unstructured) [knowledge and practices](2/2/3/3/3/2/.Knowledge) [that guide and](3/3/2/2/2/2/3/.Mentor%20and%20Guide) shape current realities.

Yet, traditions, in their [maintenance of status](3/1/3/1/3/3/.Maintenance) quo, often resist change, marking unresolved [tension between the](3/1/1/1/1/1/2/1/2/_Tension-Release) [familiar comfort of](2/1/3/1/3/1/.Softness) [the old and](3/3/2/3/3/1/_Old-New) [the risky allure](2/1/2/3/2/2/.Risk%20Aversion) of the new.
