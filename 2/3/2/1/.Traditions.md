Traditions, pivotal to the foundation of identity and culture, offer a pathway for structure and order, operating on the continuities deeply embedded within societies. Through traditions, the wisdom and experiences of previous generations flow into the present, providing a structured frame of knowledge and practices that guide and shape current realities. They mirror a collective memory of what has been, anchoring us to our origins. Yet, traditions, in their maintenance of status quo, often resist change, marking unresolved tension between the familiar comfort of the old and the risky allure of the new.
