Tradition and rebellion, in their opposition, form the antinomic mutual relation â€” the intriguing combination of Tradition-Revolution. This relation reflects the dialectical tension between maintaining what exists and agitating for change, between prizing continuity and valuing innovation, between the known and the unknown. It encapsulates the cyclical paradigm of evolution and transformation in human societies, expressing a perpetual oscillation between tradition and rebellion that shapes the development of knowledge fields. While traditions ensure the survival and continuity of established knowledge, rebellions provoke advancements, ensuring progress and vitality. Thus, the dynamism of human progress is the result of the interaction between Tradition and Revolution, each enabling and necessitating the other.
