Seizure of power is the culmination of a revolution. It represents the shift from the old regime to a new one, the transition from servitude under existing conditions to leadership in shaping what comes next. This transformation is not mere acquisition, but rather a restructuring of society, a change in the balance of power. It is encapsulated in what Che Guevara said, "The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall."
