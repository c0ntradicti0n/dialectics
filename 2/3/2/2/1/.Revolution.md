Revolution represents societal transformation, a complete overturning of the current order. It involves both the destruction of static traditions and the creation of new, dynamic social contracts. The concept of revolution is a nuanced interplay between the old and the new, as philosopher Hannah Arendt notes, "Revolutionaries do not make revolutions. The revolutionaries are those who know when power is lying in the street and then can pick it up."
