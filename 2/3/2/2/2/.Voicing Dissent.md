Voicing dissent is an algebra of revolution. It is the expression of disagreement or opposition to the prevailing status quo. It's a necessary precursor to societal change. As a tool of resistance, it challenges tradition, sparks dialogues, and can ultimately initiate societal transformations. Martin Luther King Jr., a prominent voice of dissent, stated powerfully, "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."
