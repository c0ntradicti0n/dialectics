An abundance of knowledge is a contemporary social and cognitive paradigm, fired by unceasing advancements in technology and the expansion of the information age. This, in turn, has democratized access to knowledge and inflated the available intellectual resources. Yet, this abundance also poses challenges, with the need for veracity checks for information, increased selectivity for valid and significant knowledge, and the consequences of misinformation or superficial understanding. Thus, in navigating the seas of knowledge, the compass of wisdom – the judicious and efficacious application of knowledge – becomes ever more necessary for meaningful progress.
