The philosophy of science is a discipline concerned with analyzing, explicating, and, ultimately, questioning the foundations, methods, and implications of science. It explores the relationship between scientific knowledge and reality and wrestles with inquiries about the nature of scientific explanation, the structure of scientific theories, the role of evidence and falsification, the demarcation of scientific practices from pseudoscientific ones, and their socio-politico-ethical implications. The philosophy of science is essentially trying to understand what we mean when we claim to know something scientifically.
