Causality in scientific understanding revolves around the concept of cause and effect relationships. It asserts that every event in the universe is conditioned by a cause. This premise is fundamental for scientific investigations, as it allows the prediction and experimental verification of outcomes, based on given causal agents. Albert Einstein famously stated, "A scientist must indeed be a man who knows the laws of causality."
