Scientific realism holds that the world's true nature is accessible through scientific understanding. It affirms the belief that our best scientific theories represent a world of unobservable entities and phenomena. This worldview endorses the theories and entities postulated by science, such as atoms and quarks, even if they aren't directly observable. As staunch rationalist Immanuel Kant said, "All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason."
