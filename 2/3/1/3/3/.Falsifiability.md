Falsifiability, posited by Karl Popper, is the tenet insisting that a theory must be disconfirmable to be considered scientific. It asserts that science advances through hypothetico-deductive methods. A scientific theory proposes falsifiable hypotheses that generate testable predictions. If these predictions fail, the theory becomes falsified. Popper highlighted this principle by stating, "In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be falsifiable; and in so far as it is not falsifiable, it does not speak about reality."
