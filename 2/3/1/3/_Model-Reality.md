Model-reality interaction in scientific realism is a complex relationship. It grapples with the nature of scientific models as representations of an unknowable reality. The model's validity is based on how successful it is in explaining and predicting phenomena, despite the inevitable dissimilarities with reality it represents. As physicist Richard Feynman has famously said, "It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong."
