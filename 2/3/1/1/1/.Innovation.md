Innovation refers to the process of introducing new or significantly improved ideas, products, or processes. It is integral to progress and growth in areas such as business, technology, science, and social practices. Innovation often requires creativity, ingenuity, and entrepreneurial spirit. Innovations are both revolutionary, disrupting existing norms and structures, and evolutionary, improving existing systems. The famous quote by Steve Jobs, "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower," speaks to the key role innovation plays in leadership and success.
