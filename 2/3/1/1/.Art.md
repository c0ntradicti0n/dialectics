Art is a human expression that transcends words and literal comprehension. It is the language of creation and interpretation, reflecting the world around us and reproducing the thought processes of the creator. Art serves as a window to the inner workings and hidden perspectives of the human mind, ranging from the most mundane to the highly profound experiences. It is a product of evolution, bound to culture - but also shaping it, and pushing its boundaries, in a symbiotic relationship between the creator and the creation.
