In the context of art, judgments create standards and values, forming an objective or subjective evaluation of an art piece based on aesthetic, cultural, or personal factors. These judgments affect how art is perceived, valued, and interacted with by the public and the creators themselves. John Keats once said, "‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know," emphasizing the subjective and personal aspect of judgments in art.
