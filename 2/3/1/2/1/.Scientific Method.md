The scientific method is a systematic procedure followed in scientific investigation. It involves making observations, formulating a hypothesis, designing and conducting experiments to test the hypothesis, and analyzing the results. The scientific method enables the evolution of scientific knowledge and is vital to scientific progress. As Richard Feynman said, "It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong."
