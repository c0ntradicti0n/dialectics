Paradigm shifts are epistemic upheavals that transform established scientific understanding. Thomas Kuhn, who coined the term, described it as a profound change in the basic concepts, experimental practices, and methodological frameworks of a scientific discipline. Newtonian physics giving way to Einstein's theory of relativity is an example of a paradigm shift. Kuhn himself observed, "Normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory and, when successful, finds none."
