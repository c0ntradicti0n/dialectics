Methodology and epistemology are integral components of scientific research. Methodology refers to the procedural aspect, specifying the methods and techniques used in investigation. Epistemology pertains to the philosophical understanding of knowledge, focusing on aspects like its nature, sources, limits, and justification. Both interact dynamically, with methodology shaping the practice of scientific research and epistemology guiding its philosophical framework. Friedrich Nietzsche commented, "There are no facts, only interpretations," reflecting an epistemological perspective emphasizing the subjectivity and context-dependency of knowledge. His remarks suggest that our methodologies also inherently carry our interpretive framework.
