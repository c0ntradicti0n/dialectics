Measurement is the process of quantifying phenomena according to agreed-upon standards. It is fundamental to empirical sciences and enables scientists to describe, compare, and understand phenomena. Measurements can be qualitative, describing the quality of something, or quantitative, providing numerical value. The philosopher Immanuel Kant once said, "All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason." This quote suggests that measurement, in the context of quantitative data collected by the senses, serves as the starting point for knowledge construction.
