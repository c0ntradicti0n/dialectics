[The science of](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) science, also known as scientometrics, brings [an analytical approach](2/3/1/2/1/3/.Analysis) [to the study](3/2/1/1/1/.Investigating) of science itself. [It is the](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/1/1/.Thermosetting) [objective exploration of](2/3/1/2/1/2/.Experimentation) [scientific knowledge production](3/2/1/1/1/.Investigating) and distribution processes. [This field probes](1/3/1/1/1/3/1/1/_Charge-Field) into metrics, methods, policies, and practices [involved in scientific](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) [research and examines](1/2/2/2/2/3/1/3/.Research) [their sociological and](2/3/3/3/1/3/2/2/.Sociocultural%20Aspects) philosophical implications. The [science of science](2/3/1/2/.Science%20of%20Science) [interprets the methodology](2/3/1/2/1/3/.Analysis) [and epistemology of](2/3/2/3/3/2/.Epistemology) scientific knowledge, scrutinizing [its own foundations](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) [while creating meta-scientific](2/3/1/2/1/.Scientific%20Method) knowledge.
