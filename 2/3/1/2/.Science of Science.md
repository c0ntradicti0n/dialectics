The science of science, also known as scientometrics, brings an analytical approach to the study of science itself. It is the objective exploration of scientific knowledge production and distribution processes. This field probes into metrics, methods, policies, and practices involved in scientific research and examines their sociological and philosophical implications. The science of science interprets the methodology and epistemology of scientific knowledge, scrutinizing its own foundations while creating meta-scientific knowledge.
