Jurisprudential systems reflect our shared understanding of justice, legality, and the rule of law. They navigate the delicate dialectic between prescriptive norms and evolving societal conventions, striving to mediate the tension between individual freedom and the societal order. As legal codices set the stage for fairness and equanimity, so too does interpretation augment these standards, instilling dynamism and relevance into our conception of justice. Lawyer and jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. noted, "The life of the law has not been logic, it has been experience."
