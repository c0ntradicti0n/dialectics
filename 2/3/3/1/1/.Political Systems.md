Political systems denote the organization and conduct of public affairs within socio-cultural contexts, shaping our collective perceptions of governance, power, law, and responsibility. The oscillation between democratic ideals and autocratic pragmatism reveals the complex interplay of subjectivity and objectivity within these systems. They serve as a crucible for our ideological convictions and pragmatic compromises, driving the evolution of societal structures. John F. Kennedy once said, "Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer."
