Economic systems are distinguished by their structure and methods for solving the universal economic problem - the scarcity of resources. The thesis of an economic system lies in its organization of production, distribution, trade, and allocation of resources. This structural arrangement might be directed towards a capitalistic free market model, where private firms and individuals control production, and distribution is guided by the 'invisible hand' of the market. The system leverages competition and profit motive to efficiently allot resources.
