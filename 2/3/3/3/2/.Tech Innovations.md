Technological innovations represent breakthrough developments reshaping our societal structures. They offer transformative possibilities, yet also pose challenges demanding new societal adaptations. Tech innovations suggest a ceaseless process of becoming, marked by the constant transition from old to new. As Peter Drucker noted, "Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurshipâ€¦it is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth."
