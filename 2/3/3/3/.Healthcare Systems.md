[The synthesis between](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [these two systems](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) [may be seen](3/1/3/1/3/1/_See-Unseen) [in the healthcare](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/3/3/3/.Public%20Hospitals) system, where elements [from both economic](3/1/3/3/.Economy) [and educational structures](2/3/3/2/.Education%20Systems) are integrated. Healthcare [systems often function](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) [within a regulated](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/2/2/.Regulation) market, balancing capitalism's [competitive dynamics with](3/1/3/3/2/.Market%20Dynamics) [state oversight to](3/2/3/2/1/2/.State%20intervention) prevent market failure. [It's also an](3/2/2/1/1/1/2/1/.Accessory) educational system, responsible [for training healthcare](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/3/3/3/.Public%20Hospitals) [professionals and educating](3/1/3/3/3/1/1/2/2/.Education) [the public about](3/1/3/1/2/3/2/3/.Public%20Awareness) health issues. It [is a system](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) in flux, grappling [with issues such](3/2/2/2/1/1/.Obligations) as resource allocation, accessibility, quality of care, and innovations in medical technology.
