Software development represents the creative and technical process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining computer programs or applications. It harnesses the capacity of digital technology to execute complex tasks and solve specific problems. Through this process, objectivity meets subjectivity in the rendition of functional lines of code, embodying both structuring logic and innovative solutions, often leveraging both open and closed-source paradigms. "The best way to predict the future is to invent it," wise words from Alan Kay, a computer scientist.
