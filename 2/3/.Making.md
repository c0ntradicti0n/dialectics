Values, in contrast [to the rigid](2/2/2/1/3/3/2/_Rigid-Flexible%20Transformation) [confines of Natural](2/1/1/3/2/2/1/.Natural%20Caves) Necessity, are the [abstract ideals or](2/3/2/1/3/1/3/.Universal%20Ideals) [principles deemed significant](3/2/2/3/3/2/.Principles) [by individuals or](3/2/3/1/3/_Collective-Individual) collectives. They are [subjective determinants that](2/2/3/2/2/_Subjective-Objective%20Knowledge) shape actions, behaviors, and judgments. Values might be moral, aesthetic, or utilitarian, [representing what is](1/1/3/1/1/2/3/.Representational) considered "good," "beautiful," or "useful" respectively. However, these assessments [are not just](3/2/3/3/2/3/.Pluralism) personal whims; they [often emerge as](1/2/2/2/1/3/1/3/.Emergent) [a synthesis of](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [internal desires and](2/2/2/2/3/2/3/.Desire) external influences. While [values offer a](3/1/3/3/2/3/1/.Price) [counterpoint to the](2/2/2/3/1/1/_Implication-Contradiction) [unyielding nature of](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/1/_Rigid-Flexible) necessity, they themselves [require a means](2/3/1/2/3/.Measurement) of realization, a process, or an action, leading to [the concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) Making.
