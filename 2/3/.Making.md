Values, in contrast to the rigid confines of Natural Necessity, are the abstract ideals or principles deemed significant by individuals or collectives. They are subjective determinants that shape actions, behaviors, and judgments. Values might be moral, aesthetic, or utilitarian, representing what is considered "good," "beautiful," or "useful" respectively. However, these assessments are not just personal whims; they often emerge as a synthesis of internal desires and external influences. While values offer a counterpoint to the unyielding nature of necessity, they themselves require a means of realization, a process, or an action, leading to the concept of Making.
