Invention and adaptation form a vital dialectic in the unfolding of the human story. While invention marks the birth of new ideas, objects, or methods, adaptation represents the process of reshaping and refining these inventions to fit changing circumstances or needs. This reciprocal interaction is the lifeblood of progress, pushing the bounds of the possible and continually reshaping our world.
