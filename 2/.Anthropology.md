Anthropology, the study of human beings, societies, and cultures, investigates humanity's biological, social, and cultural dimensions. While metaphysics explores abstract principles and the fundamental nature of existence, anthropology focuses on humans and their societies, seeking to understand human life and behavior within various cultural contexts. This exploration creates a potential antithesis to metaphysics, grounding the lofty considerations of the metaphysical in the particularities of human culture and existence.
