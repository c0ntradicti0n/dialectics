The concept of scarcity and abundance relates to the availability of resources in relation to the demand or need for them. Scarcity refers to a situation where resources are limited and cannot fully meet the needs or desires of individuals or societies. This scarcity often leads to competition, as individuals or groups vie for access to the limited resources. On the other hand, abundance signifies a state where resources are plentiful and can meet the demands of individuals or societies.
