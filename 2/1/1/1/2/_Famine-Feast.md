The juxtaposition of famine and feast highlights the contrasting extremes in the availability of food resources. Famine symbolizes a period of widespread scarcity and inadequate food supply, often resulting from natural disasters, conflicts, or socioeconomic factors. Conversely, feast represents a state of abundance, where food is plentiful and accessible, allowing for a surplus and often leading to celebratory and indulgent practices.
