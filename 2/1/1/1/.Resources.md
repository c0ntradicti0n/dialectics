Resources are tangible and intangible assets that fulfill the essential physiological needs for a living organism's survival and growth. They encompass the elements that are extracted from the environment like water, air, minerals, and energy, as well as food resources acquired through hunting or agriculture. Without these resources, organisms cannot sustain their lives or engage in growth and reproduction.
