Resources refer to the available assets that can be used to satisfy human needs and wants. They include natural, financial, human, and man-made resources. While some resources are infinite, like sunlight, others, such as fossil fuels, are finite. The extraction, distribution, and consumption of resources play a fundamental role in societal structures, economies, and geopolitics. The inherent tension arises from the scarcity of certain resources, leading to competition, innovation, and sometimes conflict.
