Housing is the environment in which individuals and families live, and it impacts their health, educational outcomes, employment prospects, and general wellbeing. Good housing is characterized by suitability, adequacy, affordability, and stability. However, significant disparities in housing are present in society and have critical implications for health and social well-being. On the other hand, inadequate housing, marked by overcrowding, instability, and poor-quality living conditions, contributes to physical and mental health disorders. "Housing is a human right.
