The concepts of social and private relate to the ownership and control of means of production within different modes of production. Social ownership refers to collective or state control of production means, with the goal of promoting communal interests and equitable resource distribution. Private ownership, on the other hand, signifies individual or corporate control of production means, often driven by profit motives and individual decision-making.
