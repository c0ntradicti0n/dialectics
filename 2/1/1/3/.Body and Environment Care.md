Body and environment care describes the necessary, conscious actions taken to ensure the optimum physiological functioning amidst an external environment. For instance, organisms may adjust their diet, sleep, and exercise patterns for better health, or they may modify their environment to reduce exposure to potential harm. They balance the necessity to utilize resources with the exertion of care for both their bodies and the environments from which resources are drawn.
