Health is the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. It is an essential resource for living that contributes to a person's quality of life, their ability to pursue their goals, satisfy their needs, and cope with the environment. Health is therefore a crucial element of an individual's capacity to function within society and interact with the world. When health is compromised through illness or injury, the individual's ability to engage effectively in these activities is impeded. "The greatest wealth is health." - Virgil
