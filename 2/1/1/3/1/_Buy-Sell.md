The interplay between buying and selling forms the foundation of market operations. Buying refers to the acquisition of goods or services in exchange for money or other forms of payment. Selling, on the other hand, involves offering goods or services for purchase. The exchange of goods and services through buying and selling contributes to economic growth and the satisfaction of individual and societal needs.
