The economy is a structured system wherein resources are produced, distributed, and consumed. It's a web of interrelated activities, driven by the dual forces of supply and demand. Rooted in scarcity, the economy concerns the allocation of limited resources to meet unlimited human wants. The balance is maintained through market mechanisms, policies, and societal values. While it provides a means for growth and development, the interconnectedness also results in vulnerabilities, disparities, and cyclic fluctuations.
