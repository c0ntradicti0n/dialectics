Social interactions are the processes by which individuals act, react, and influence each other. They are a fundamental component of social structures and are necessary for the formation and maintenance of social relations, norms, and institutions. Social interactions range from fleeting informal contacts to highly structured formal interdependencies and have significant consequences for individuals and societies. These interactions shape our experiences, our knowledge about the world, and ultimately, our identities. "Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally or not by accident, is either beneath our notice or more than human." - Aristotle - Aristotle - Aristotle - Aristotle - Aristotle - Aristotle - Aristotle - Aristotle
