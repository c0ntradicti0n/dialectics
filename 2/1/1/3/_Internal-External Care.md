Internal-external care is a dialectic that explores the balance and interaction between self-care and the care received from others or society. Internally, each individual carries the responsibility of maintaining their mental, physical, and emotional health. Externally, societal structures, public policies, and interpersonal relationships play vital roles in nurturing health and well-being. This dialectic explains that these two types of care are not mutually exclusive but rather function in a symbiotic relationship where the deficiency of one emphasizes the importance of the other.
