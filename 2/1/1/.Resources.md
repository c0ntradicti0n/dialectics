Resources are essential elements that enable the survival and flourishing of life. They encompass both tangible and intangible assets that contribute to the well-being and sustenance of individuals and communities. Resources can include natural resources such as water, air, and land, as well as human-made resources such as technology, infrastructure, and knowledge. The availability and distribution of resources impact the quality of life and shape societal structures, leading to dynamics of dependence, rights, and responsibilities.
