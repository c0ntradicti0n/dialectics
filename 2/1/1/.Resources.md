Resources pertain to the tangible and intangible assets that are available to societies, individuals, and ecosystems for sustaining and enhancing life. These encompass natural resources like water, minerals, and fossil fuels, as well as human-made assets such as technology and infrastructure. While resources inherently possess potential utility, their true value emerges when harnessed effectively. Yet, the finite nature of many resources introduces constraints, and an indiscriminate exploitation risks depleting them, threatening the equilibrium of our existence.
