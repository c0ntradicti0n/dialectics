**Thesis:** Resources are the essential elements required for the sustenance and development of life. They encompass all the materials, energy, and other assets that individuals and societies need to meet their needs and fulfill their desires. Resources can include natural resources such as water, land, and minerals, as well as human-made resources like technology and infrastructure.

**Antithesis:** However, the availability and distribution of resources are not equal for everyone. There exists a dependency relationship between individuals and resources, where some individuals have access to an abundance of resources while others experience deprivation. This disparity creates imbalances of power and privilege, leading to inequalities in society.

**Synthesis:** The synthesis of resources and dependency is the concept of responsibility. Alongside the rights individuals possess concerning resources, they also bear responsibilities toward their fellow human beings and the environment. Responsibility entails ensuring equitable distribution of resources, taking care of the environment, and considering the long-term sustainability of resource usage.

**Antinomic Mutual Relation:** The antinomic mutual relation within the synthesis of responsibility and resources is the "deprivation-confrontation." Deprivation arises when individuals or communities lack sufficient resources to meet their basic needs. This deprivation can lead to social tensions and conflicts. However, through a collective commitment to responsibility, individuals and societies can confront deprivation by working toward fair resource allocation and addressing social inequalities.
