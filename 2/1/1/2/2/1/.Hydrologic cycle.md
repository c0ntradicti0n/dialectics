The hydrologic cycle, also known as the water cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. It involves processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff, which contribute to the distribution and availability of freshwater resources. The hydrologic cycle is essential for the sustenance of life and the functioning of natural ecosystems.
