The concepts of heterosexuality and homosexuality are fundamental to the understanding of sexual orientation. Heterosexuality refers to a sexual attraction towards individuals of the opposite sex, while homosexuality refers to a sexual attraction towards individuals of the same sex. The interplay between hetero- and homo- orientations contributes to the rich tapestry of human diversity in terms of personal relationships and expressions of love.
