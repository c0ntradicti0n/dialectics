Sterility and fertility represent the contrasting capacities to conceive and reproduce. Sterility refers to the inability to conceive offspring, often due to factors such as infertility or reproductive disorders. Fertility, on the other hand, signifies the ability to conceive and bear children. The dichotomy between sterility and fertility can have profound personal, cultural, and social implications.
