Starvation represents a state of extreme malnutrition resulting from a prolonged lack of adequate food intake. It occurs when the body's energy reserves are depleted, leading to severe physiological and metabolic disruptions. Starvation poses significant health risks and can lead to various complications and ultimately, if left untreated, death.
