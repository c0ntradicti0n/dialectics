Sexuality encompasses a spectrum of identities, expressions, and experiences related to how individuals perceive themselves and relate to others on a sexual level. It's a dynamic interplay of biological, sociocultural, and psychological factors. As an inherent aspect of human nature, sexuality plays a significant role in personal identity, cultural norms, and societal structures. The dichotomy arises from the traditional understanding of male and female, which contrasts with a more fluid understanding of gender and sexual orientation.
