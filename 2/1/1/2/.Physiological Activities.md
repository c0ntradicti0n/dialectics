Physiological activities are the essential bodily processes that enable an organism's survival, growth, and reproduction. They include diverse activities such as digestion, respiration, excretion, and sleep, which maintain and restore resource balances internally. These processes often operate automatically and are integral to an organism's health and well-being. Even minor disruptions to them could lead to a multitude of physical ailments.
