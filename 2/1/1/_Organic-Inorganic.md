The organic-inorganic dialectic denotes the tension between living and non-living systems. While organic systems encompass life, growth, and natural processes, inorganic systems are static, devoid of life and metabolic functions. This dichotomy is evident in resources: while some are derived from living organisms (like timber or fish), others come from inorganic sources (like minerals or water). This interplay has profound implications on sustainability, ecology, and human intervention.
