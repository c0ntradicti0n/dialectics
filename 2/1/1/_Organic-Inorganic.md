This relationship permeates the cycle of resource acquisition, physiological activity, and body/environment care. It reflects the interaction between the organic -- the living organism and its processes -- and the inorganic -- the nonliving resources and environment. The inorganic elements are assimilated into the organism through physiological activities, while care of the body and environment ensures continued access to these resources.
