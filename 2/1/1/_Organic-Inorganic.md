[The organic-inorganic dialectic](2/1/1/_Organic-Inorganic) [denotes the tension](3/1/1/1/1/1/2/1/2/_Tension-Release) [between living and](3/3/2/2/2/1/2/.Life%20and%20Death) non-living systems. While [organic systems encompass](2/1/1/_Organic-Inorganic) life, growth, and natural processes, inorganic systems are static, [devoid of life](1/1/3/2/1/1/2/1/.Immobility) and metabolic functions. [This dichotomy is](1/1/3/3/_Homogeneity-Heterogeneity) evident in resources: [while some are](2/2/2/3/2/1/.Ad%20Hominem) [derived from living](3/1/1/1/1/2/3/2/.Bio-derived) [organisms (like timber](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Ecosystems) or fish), others [come from inorganic](1/3/1/2/3/_Organic-Inorganic) [sources (like minerals](3/1/1/1/1/2/1/.Natural%20Materials) or water). This [interplay has profound](2/1/1/3/3/.Social%20Interactions) implications on sustainability, ecology, and human intervention.
