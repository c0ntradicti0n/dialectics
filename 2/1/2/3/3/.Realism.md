Realism is the attitude or practice of accepting a situation as it is and being prepared to deal with it appropriately. Despite the positivity of the optimist or the negativity of the pessimist, realism provides a balanced perspective, accepting all possibilities and focusing on what can be done within existing constraints. It encourages individuals to see things in their true nature, cultivating patience and resilience. "The realist sees reality as concrete. The optimist sees reality as clay." - Robert Braathe
