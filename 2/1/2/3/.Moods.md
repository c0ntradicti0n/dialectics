Moods are longer-lasting affective states, not necessarily tied to a specific stimulus or event. Unlike emotions, they are less intense but more pervasive, providing a backdrop to our daily lives. Moods can shape our perception, cognition, and overall outlook on events. The oscillation between positive and negative moods plays a crucial role in mental well-being, resilience, and interpersonal dynamics.
