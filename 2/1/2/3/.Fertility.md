Fertility relates to the ability to conceive and reproduce, ensuring the continuity of the human species. It encompasses both male and female fertility and involves factors such as reproductive health, hormone regulation, and genetic predispositions. The concepts of sterility and fertility represent opposite ends of the spectrum, reflecting the capacity or incapacity to conceive and bear children.
