An individual's outlook is their general view, attitude, or expectation of the future. It reflects their optimism or pessimism and influences their perception of experiences, interactions, and behaviors. A positive outlook can often lead to improved mental and physical wellbeing, while a negative outlook can contribute to various health problems, barring an individual from realizing their full potential. "The world is full of a lot of fear and a lot of negativity, and a lot of judgment. I just think people need to start shifting their focus onto joy and happiness." - Ellen DeGeneres
