Optimism, as an attitude or world view, perceives the environment or situation with a bias towards positive outcomes and possibilities. It emphasizes favorable aspects of a situation, often linked with happiness and good health, while downplaying negative elements. However, unchecked optimism can lead to ignoring the reality of a situation, thus, setting up for disappointments, bringing us to its antithesis: pessimism.
