Pessimism, in singularity [with its thesis](2/3/1/2/_Methodology-Epistemology) optimism, holds an [inclination to focus](2/1/2/3/2/1/.Deficit%20Focus) [on unfavourable aspects](2/1/2/3/_Positive-Negative) [or expect the](2/1/3/3/3/1/.Expectation) worst possible outcome. [Pessimists often use](2/1/2/3/1/2/.Pessimism) [past failures or](2/3/2/3/3/_Past-Present) [unfavorable events as](2/1/2/3/_Positive-Negative) [a lens through](1/3/1/1/1/4/2/1/.Lenses) [which they view](3/3/2/3/2/3/2/.Audience%20Perspective) [their present and](1/2/2/3/.Present) future, thereby, potentially [leading to passive](2/1/1/2/_Active-Passive) [behaviours and underutilization](1/3/1/2/1/1/2/3/.Interactions) of opportunities. This [negativity can be](3/1/1/2/3/2/1/2/2/2/.Negative%20Sentiment) [balanced by the](2/1/2/3/3/1/.Balanced%20View) [incorporation of a](1/1/3/1/2/2/3/.Integration) realistic approach, establishing [the vital synthesis](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) of realism.
