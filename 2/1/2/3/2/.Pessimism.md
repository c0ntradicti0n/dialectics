Pessimism is the tendency to expect the worst or see the worst in all things. It is an attitude influenced by both individual traits and environmental factors. Pessimism often aborts creativity and aspiration, causing a person to lose sight of potential opportunities and solutions to problems. However, it also has a protective role by preparing individuals for worst-case scenarios and promoting caution in decision-making processes. "Both optimists and pessimists contribute to our society. The optimist invents the airplane, and the pessimist invents the parachute." - George Bernard Shaw
