[Feelings arise from](2/1/2/.Feelings) [the realm of](2/3/1/.Domains%20of%20Knowledge) subjectivity, distinct yet [intimately connected with](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) the objective world. [They are the](3/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Thermocouples) [internal responses to](2/2/1/1/_Inner-Strength) external stimuli, imbued with personal significance. Feelings, ranging from joy to sorrow, fear to comfort, [embody the subjective](2/.Subjectivity) [awareness of life's](2/1/3/_Aware-Unaware) experiences. They add color, texture, and [depth to one's](1/3/2/1/3/2/_Deepen-Shallow) consciousness, linking the [biological organism with](1/3/1/3/1/2/.Organismic%20Biology) [its psychic and](2/1/3/3/1/3/1/.Premonition) social existence. As such, feelings map [the experiential contour](3/2/1/2/1/.Experiential%20Learning) of life, functioning [as the navigational](3/1/1/3/3/3/2/3/.Obstacle%20Navigation%20Algorithms) [compass orienting us](1/2/3/1/2/2/.Compass%20Point) [in our personal](2/2/1/1/3/_Shared-Personal) and interpersonal worlds.
