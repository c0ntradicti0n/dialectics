Feelings arise from the realm of subjectivity, distinct yet intimately connected with the objective world. They are the internal responses to external stimuli, imbued with personal significance. Feelings, ranging from joy to sorrow, fear to comfort, embody the subjective awareness of life's experiences. They add color, texture, and depth to one's consciousness, linking the biological organism with its psychic and social existence. As such, feelings map the experiential contour of life, functioning as the navigational compass orienting us in our personal and interpersonal worlds.
