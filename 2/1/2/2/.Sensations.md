Sensations refer to the immediate physical responses to external stimuli, interpreted through our sensory organs. They are raw data, prior to being processed and given meaning by our brain. Sensations are objective and direct, be it the warmth of sunlight or the sharpness of a pinprick. The tension between attractive and repulsive sensations shapes our immediate behavioral responses and forms the basis for more complex emotional and cognitive experiences.
