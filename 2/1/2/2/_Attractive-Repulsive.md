[The antinomic relationship](2/2/2/1/_Organic-Inorganic) [in this dialectical](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) unit is Attractive-Repulsive. [It embodies the](3/3/.Cultural%20Embodiment) [subjective nature of](2/2/3/2/2/_Subjective-Objective%20Knowledge) sensory perception, where [certain stimuli may](3/1/1/3/3/2/1/1/.Sensory%20Feedback%20Loops) [be perceived as](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) [desirable (attractive) or](2/2/2/2/1/2/_Attractive-Repulsive) [undesirable (repulsive) based](2/2/2/2/1/2/_Attractive-Repulsive) on personal interpretation, past experience, and biological instincts. Ultimately, [this intrinsic polarity](1/3/1/2/2/2/1/.Polarity) [in sensory perception](2/1/3/1/.Perception) [underpins the aesthetics](3/3/2/1/3/3/.Product%20Aesthetics) [that govern human](3/2/2/1/1/2/2/2/_Ethics-Sovereignty) life.
