Intuition is an immediate and instinctive understanding, often occurring without the conscious use of reasoning. It is a form of knowledge that appears to be separate from the iterative processes of cognition and perception, relying on spontaneous and unconscious associations and experiences. While cognition relies on deliberate processing and perception on present sensory information, intuition is driven by immediate, unconsciously framed understandings that often guide us to swift decisions.
