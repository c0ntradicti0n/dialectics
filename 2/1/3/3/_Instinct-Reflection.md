The antinomy of gut feeling and insight – instant intuition versus deliberate thought – is resolved in the synthesis of forethought, presenting an emergent conflict between instinct and reflection. Forethought marries intuition and analysis but also highlights their incompatibilities, invoking the eternal tussle between the immediacy of instinct as well as the patience of reflection. This mediation, however, enables us to grow wise in our decisions, hence resolving the antinomy in the process.
