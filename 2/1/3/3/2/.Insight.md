Insight, unlike gut feeling, is the [fruit of intense](2/1/2/2/2/_Sweetness-Sourness) [contemplation and rational](1/1/2/3/1/2/.Rational) deliberation. It reflects [an understanding that](2/1/3/3/2/2/.Understanding) [is sharply defined](3/1/3/1/1/1/_Blunt-Edged) and articulated, established [within a framework](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/.Frameworks) [of references and](1/3/1/2/3/3/2/3/3/3/.Certified%20Reference%20Materials) [built upon previous](2/1/1/3/2/2/2/.Built%20Structures) knowledge. It is [path to accessing](3/1/2/3/2/3/.Unauthorized%20access) [patterns and contextual](1/1/2/3/3/.Pattern) [knowledge that intuition](2/1/3/3/.Intuition) might overlook. Nonetheless, [its precision may](2/3/1/2/3/3/_Precision-Accuracy) [come at the](1/1/3/3/2/3/1/.Gathering) cost of spontaneity; [a strength that](1/3/1/2/3/1/1/1/.Strength) gut feeling maintains.
