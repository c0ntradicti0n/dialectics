Thought constitutes the mental process in which ideas and associations are formed. It provides the basis for understanding, decision making, creativity, and problem-solving. However, thought in itself, without recollection of past experiences, cannot fully comprehend the nature of an event or an idea. Hence, it points to its antithesis, memory.
