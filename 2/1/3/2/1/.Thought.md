Thought is the process of generating intentional cognitive content. It allows individuals to make sense of the world around them, solve problems, make decisions, and create new ideas. Thought ranges from simple perceptual processing to the complex elaboration of concepts and reasoning. It is the point of intersection between individual mental activity and the external world, shaping our perception and understanding of reality. "All that we are is the result of what we have thought." - Buddha
