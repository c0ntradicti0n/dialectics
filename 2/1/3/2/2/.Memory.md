Memory is the cognitive ability to encode, store, and retrieve information. It plays a crucial role in the functioning of human consciousness, allowing us to maintain continuity and identity over time. Memory links experiences across time by preserving and recalling events and facts, influencing present cognition and future anticipation. However, its fallible and reconstructive nature blurs the line between objective reality and subjective interpretation. "We are what we remember. If we lose our memory, we lose our identity." - Samuel Johnson
