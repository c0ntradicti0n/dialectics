The abstract-concrete dialectic captures the tension between the concrete - the tangible and factual, and the abstract - the conceptual and theoretical. This dialectic is fundamental to cognition as it frames the way we perceive, understand, and navigate the world. Concrete thinking allows us to grasp the objective reality, while abstract thinking enables us to transcend beyond the tangible and perceive broader notions, concepts, and experiences.
