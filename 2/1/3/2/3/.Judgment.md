Judgment is the ability to form an opinion, make a decision, or infer something after consideration. It reflects the synthesis of thought and memory. Judgment incorporates both the process of thinking, generating ideas and contemplating situations, and recalling past experiences for contextual understanding, to shape well-reasoned conclusions and decisions.
