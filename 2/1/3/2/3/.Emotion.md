Emotion is a psychological state that arises spontaneously rather than through conscious effort, often accompanied by physiological changes, influencing thoughts and behavior. Emotions, being complex and multi-faceted, are subjective, conscious experiences perceived through personal cultural, philosophical, and empirical views, coloring our perception of reality and dictating our reactions to it. They are the fundamental underpinning of human consciousness that breach the divide between thought and action. "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart." - Helen Keller
