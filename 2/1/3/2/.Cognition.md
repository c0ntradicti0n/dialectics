Cognition is the mental act of processing and understanding information received from the world around us. Unlike perception which is immediate, cognition requires mental faculties such as memory, attention, reasoning and judgment to elicit meaning from stimuli. It absorbs, filters, and organizes information perceived by the senses. Cognition allows us to make connections between different pieces of information, help us recognize patterns, and make decisions based on past experiences and foreknowledge.
