Economy refers to the structured system where goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed. It's the heartbeat of human society, reflecting our needs, desires, and aspirations. At its core, the economy is a dance of supply and demand, balancing what's available with what's desired. It not only signifies wealth creation and distribution but also mirrors societal values, priorities, and advancements. Yet, the pursuit of economic growth can sometimes overlook ethical considerations, challenging the harmony between prosperity and morality.
