Consciousness fundamentally refers to the state of being aware. It encompasses self-awareness and the awareness of the world. As a dimension of the mind, it is the gateway to perception, cognition, feeling, and volition. Consciousness opens upon the world and reflects upon itself, providing the frame through which reality is interpreted and acted upon. It empowers the living being with freedom, intelligence, and purpose, setting in motion processes of understanding, learning, and creativity, making personal and communal life possible.
