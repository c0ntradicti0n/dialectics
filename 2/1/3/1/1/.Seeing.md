Seeing, as a sensory modality, processes visual stimuli and provides a representation of the world around us. It involves the complex interplay between light, the eye, and the brain, leading us to perceive shapes, colors, distances and movement. However, seeing alone does not encompass the entirety of our sensory experiences, leading us to its antithesis, hearing.
