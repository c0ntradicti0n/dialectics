Seeing, as a sensory modality, processes [visual stimuli and](2/1/3/1/1/.Seeing) [provides a representation](1/1/3/1/1/2/3/.Representational) [of the world](3/3/3/2/1/3/.Master%20of%20Two%20Worlds) around us. It [involves the complex](3/3/3/1/1/1/_Simple-Complex) interplay between light, the eye, and the brain, leading [us to perceive](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) shapes, colors, distances and movement. However, [seeing alone does](2/1/3/1/1/.Seeing) [not encompass the](1/2/1/1/3/_All-encompassing) [entirety of our](1/2/1/1/3/_All-encompassing) sensory experiences, leading [us to its](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/1/2/.Universal%20Provision) antithesis, hearing.
