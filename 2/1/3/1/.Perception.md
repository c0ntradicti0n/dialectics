Perception is the immediate awareness or sensory interpretation of our environment, through the combined senses - sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. Perception works with cognition to shape our understanding of the world, imbuing our experiences with quality and depth. Perception operates in the raw immediacy of the present moment, relying on various environmental stimuli to create an interpretive framework that forms the basis of our experience.
