Feeling incorporates the sensory inputs of sight, sound, and touch to provide a comprehensive perception of our environment. It transcends beyond merely experiencing sensory inputs to interpreting and responding to them. This synthesis of sight, sound, and touch allows us to navigate through and interact with our surroundings in a more meaningful and efficient manner.
