[Hearing diverges from](3/2/1/3/2/.Auditory) [seeing by focusing](2/1/3/1/1/.Seeing) [on the audio](3/1/1/1/1/1/2/2/2/_Image-Sound) [aspects of our](2/3/3/.Human%20Endeavors) environment. It is [the sensory perception](2/1/3/1/.Perception) of sound, characterized [by the detection](3/3/3/3/3/2/_Detection-Evasion) [of vibrations and](1/3/1/2/3/3/2/1/1/2/1/.Stretching%20Vibrations) changes in pressure. [While seeing provides](2/1/1/3/3/2/.Observing) [us with details](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/3/3/3/.Public%20Hospitals) [of shape and](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) color, hearing allows [us to perceive](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) pitch, volume, and tone. Yet, the [synthesis of these](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [two sensory modes](2/1/3/1/_Visual-Auditory-Tactile) [with the sense](2/2/1/1/1/3/.Conviction) [of touch forms](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/1/2/.Differential%20Forms) [a more comprehensive](2/3/1/2/3/_Qualitative-Quantitative) sensory perception, i.e., feeling.
