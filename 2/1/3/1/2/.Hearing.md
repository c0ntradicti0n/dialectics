Hearing diverges from seeing by focusing on the audio aspects of our environment. It is the sensory perception of sound, characterized by the detection of vibrations and changes in pressure. While seeing provides us with details of shape and color, hearing allows us to perceive pitch, volume, and tone. Yet, the synthesis of these two sensory modes with the sense of touch forms a more comprehensive sensory perception, i.e., feeling.
