The tension between fatalism and free will is an age-old philosophical and existential debate. Fatalism purports that all events are predetermined, governed by fate or divine will, rendering human agency inconsequential. Contrarily, free will champions the idea of humans as autonomous beings, capable of influencing their destinies. This dialectic poses significant implications for morality, responsibility, and purpose. While some view life as a pre-written script, others believe in the power of choice, constantly shaping and reshaping life's narrative.
