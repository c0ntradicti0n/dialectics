Fatalism-Free will represents an enduring philosophical problem, often framed as the antinomy between determinism and freedom. It oscillates between believing that all events, actions, and decisions are inescapably predetermined by forces beyond individual control (fatalism) and asserting the capability of self-determination and self-initiated activities (free will). Life in a raw environment embodies this tension vividly. It sets in relief the limits imposed by nature and biology and opportunities crafted by intelligence and adaptability, offering a dialectical understanding of the drama of life. This juxtaposition of determinancy and autonomy forms a symbiotic relationship deeply embedded in the existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life. existential narrative of human life.
