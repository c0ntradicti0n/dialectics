Natural necessity refers to the basic requirements that are essential for the survival and well-being of living organisms. These necessities include food, water, shelter, and protection from harm. Natural necessity is rooted in the biological and physiological needs of organisms, ensuring their continued existence and propagation. Without fulfilling these basic requirements, life cannot be sustained, and organisms may struggle or perish.
