[Dimensional progression captures](1/2/_Dimensional%20Progression) [the evolving understanding](2/3/2/.Generation%20Evolution) [of the spatial](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Spatial) [and temporal dimensions](1/2/1/3/1/1/.Temporal%20Dimension) that define our universe. Starting with [the simple Cartesian](1/2/1/1/1/1/1/1/.Cartesian) [planes that map](1/2/1/3/1/2/3/_Plane-Space) [our immediate spatial](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Spatial) surroundings, our understanding [deepens with the](1/3/2/1/3/2/_Deepen-Shallow) addition of the temporal dimension. The [progression doesn't halt](1/1/3/2/1/3/.Progression) there. Advanced theories [in physics hint](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) at even more dimensions, some curled up at scales [beyond our current](1/1/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) means of detection. [This progression not](1/1/3/2/1/3/.Progression) only expands the [canvas of existence](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) but also uncovers [the intricate relations](1/3/1/3/1/3/.Ecological%20Relationships) and forces that stitch space and time into a coherent, unified fabric.
