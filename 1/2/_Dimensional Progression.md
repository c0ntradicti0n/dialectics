Dimensional progression captures the evolving understanding of the spatial and temporal dimensions that define our universe. Starting with the simple Cartesian planes that map our immediate spatial surroundings, our understanding deepens with the addition of the temporal dimension. The progression doesn't halt there. Advanced theories in physics hint at even more dimensions, some curled up at scales beyond our current means of detection. This progression not only expands the canvas of existence but also uncovers the intricate relations and forces that stitch space and time into a coherent, unified fabric.
