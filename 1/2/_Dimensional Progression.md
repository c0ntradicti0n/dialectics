Dimensional progression embodies the notion of constructing higher dimensions from lower ones, akin to generating a continuum from discrete elements. In simpler geometric terms, a line can be seen as an accumulation of points, an area as a collection of lines, and a volume as a layering of areas. This idea can be further extrapolated to the concept of space-time, where time isn't just 'added' to space, but rather interwoven with it to form a new continuum - a four-dimensional fabric. This progression isn't merely a physical 'stacking', but an abstracted extension that expands our understanding of the universe's structure. This expansion paves the way for the consideration of further dimensions beyond our familiar four, contributing to theories like string theory that posit a multiverse within higher-dimensional space. Thus, dimensional progression serves as the underlying foundation of a higher-dimensional universe.
