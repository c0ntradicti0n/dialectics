Lift absorbs influences from both thrust and drag to generate an upward movement within the system, counteracting the inherent or imposed downward pull. Reflective of the system's ability to transcend its constraints or limitations, lift echoes the system's capacity for adaptation, evolution and growth. It is symbolic of the agency within the system, driving the transition from a state of reaction to a state of responsive action.
