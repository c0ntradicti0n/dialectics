Drag operates counter to thrust, functionality as a retarding factor that restricts the forward momentum of the system. It represents the strain a system encounters in pursuit of its mission, due to inherent nuances or environmental factors. While primarily viewed as obstructive, drag hones the system's ability to adjust, resist and regenerate, thereby amplifying its overall resilient capabilities.
