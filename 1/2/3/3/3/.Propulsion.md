Propulsion, a force [that propels an](1/2/3/3/3/1/.Thrust) object through space, represents a counteracting [force towards gravitation](1/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Gravitational%20Pull) and presents itself as a potential [way to escape](1/3/3/1/1/1/.Earth%20Escape) [the event horizon](1/1/3/1/2/1/2/.Event%20Horizon) and influence of the singularity. The [thrust and calculation](1/2/3/3/3/1/.Thrust) needed to move across vast distances [and escape gravitational](1/3/3/1/1/_Bound-Free) pulls provides opportunities [to explore cosmic](1/2/1/1/2/3/3/.Exploration) phenomena like black holes.
