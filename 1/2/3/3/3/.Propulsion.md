Propulsion, a force that propels an object through space, represents a counteracting force towards gravitation and presents itself as a potential way to escape the event horizon and influence of the singularity. The thrust and calculation needed to move across vast distances and escape gravitational pulls provides opportunities to explore cosmic phenomena like black holes.
