The Singularity signifies a point of infinite density and gravitational pull, of nonexistence or cessation of the regular laws of physics. To contemplate a singularity is to engage in a paradoxical field where normal rules are found to violate, creating such exotic))) concepts as the "Big Bang" in cosmology or "Black Holes".
