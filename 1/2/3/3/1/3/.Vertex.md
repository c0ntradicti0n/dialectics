[In a spacetime](1/2/3/.Space-Time) diagram, the vertex is where world lines intersect. Each [vertex represents event](1/2/3/3/1/3/.Vertex) [localization in the](3/1/1/2/3/3/2/_Localization-Identification) four-dimensional spacetime continuum. [Events involving mass-energy](1/3/1/1/_Energy-Matter) exchange such as [particle interactions are](1/2/1/2/1/2/1/1/.Virtual%20Particles) often depicted as vertices, indicative of change and interaction.
