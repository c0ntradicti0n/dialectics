In the context of cosmology, a point represents an infinitesimally small location within spacetime. Although it lacks spatial extension, a point is an essential tool in formulating the coordinates for a spacetime diagram. As a singularity, a point is where all known physical laws seem to fail and the fabric of spacetime curves infinitely.
