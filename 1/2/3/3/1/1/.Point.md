In the context of cosmology, a [point represents an](1/1/3/1/2/1/1/.Point) [infinitesimally small location](1/2/1/1/1/1/3/1/.Absolute%20Position) within spacetime. Although [it lacks spatial](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Spatial) extension, a point is an essential tool in formulating [the coordinates for](1/2/1/3/1/2/2/2/2/.Cartesian%20Coordinates) a spacetime diagram. As a singularity, [a point is](1/2/1/2/3/1/2/1/.Point) where all known [physical laws seem](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) to fail and the fabric of spacetime curves infinitely.
