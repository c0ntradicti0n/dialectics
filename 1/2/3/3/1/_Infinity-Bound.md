[The concepts of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) a Point, Black Hole, and Vertex [embody the infinity-bound](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/3/.Unbounded) paradox. While a [point represents the](1/1/3/1/2/1/1/.Point) [possibility of a](1/1/3/3/3/1/2/.Possibility) timeless and space-less existence, its physical [manifestation in the](3/1/1/2/2/_Manifestation-Interpretation) form a black hole reveals a [boundary where spacetime](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) is indefinitely warped. The vertex, on the other hand, [signifies the bound](1/1/3/2/3/3/2/_Bound-Unbound) interactions within this [continuum of infinite](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/3/.Cardinal%20Continuum) possibilities.
