A Black Hole is a celestial object with gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its boundary, known as the event horizon. At its core lies a singularity, a point of infinite curvature where spacetime itself breaks down. Black holes warp spacetime in their vicinity, impacting time dilation and length contraction.
