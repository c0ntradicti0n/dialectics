[A Black Hole](1/2/3/3/1/2/.Black%20Hole) is a celestial [object with gravitational](1/2/1/3/1/1/2/2/1/.Gravitational) pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its boundary, known as the event horizon. At its core lies a singularity, a point of infinite [curvature where spacetime](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/2/3/.Curvature) itself breaks down. [Black holes warp](1/2/3/3/1/2/.Black%20Hole) [spacetime in their](1/2/3/.Space-Time) vicinity, impacting time dilation and length contraction.
