The singularity, event horizon, and propulsion create a novel understanding of space-time that is centered around extremes of "Infinity-Zero". A singularity, representing infinite density, and propulsion, epitomized by a voyage to the furthest reaches of the universe, meet at the event horizon. Here where time is considered to stand still, we see a dovetailing of absolute uncertainty and infinite potential.
