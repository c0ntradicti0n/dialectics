The singularity, event horizon, and propulsion create a novel [understanding of space-time](1/2/3/.Space-Time) that is centered [around extremes of](2/3/1/3/1/3/.Limitation%20Boundaries) "Infinity-Zero". A singularity, representing infinite density, and propulsion, epitomized by a voyage [to the furthest](1/2/1/1/1/2/2/1/_Near-Far) reaches of the universe, meet at the event horizon. Here where time is considered to stand still, we see a dovetailing [of absolute uncertainty](1/2/1/2/1/2/1/3/.Uncertainty%20Principle) and infinite potential.
