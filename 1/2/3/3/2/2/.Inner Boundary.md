The inner boundary, akin to the outer boundary, is essentially a threshold that demarcates the divisions within a system. Rooted in a larger latticework of boundaries that carve out the internal structure, the inner boundary differentiates between various subsystems. These subsystems, though operationally distinct, work in an interwoven manner towards the overall objectivity of the system. Hence, the inner boundary's role is multi-facetedâ€”while it delineates divisions within the system, it also enables communication andintegrated functioning across these divisions.
