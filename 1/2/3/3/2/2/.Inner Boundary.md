The inner boundary, akin to the outer boundary, is [essentially a threshold](3/3/3/2/1/2/.Crossing%20the%20Threshold) [that demarcates the](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/1/2/.Separation%20Marks) [divisions within a](1/1/3/1/2/2/.Dividual) system. Rooted in a larger latticework [of boundaries that](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) carve out the internal structure, the [inner boundary differentiates](1/2/1/1/2/2/_Boundary-Interior) between various subsystems. These subsystems, though operationally distinct, work in an interwoven manner towards the overall objectivity of the system. Hence, [the inner boundary's](1/2/1/1/2/2/_Boundary-Interior) [role is multi-facetedâ€”while](3/3/2/2/1/2/3/.Supporting%20Characters) [it delineates divisions](1/1/2/3/1/_Whole-Fraction) within the system, it also enables [communication andintegrated functioning](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/.Communication) across these divisions.
