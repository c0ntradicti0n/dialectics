[The outer boundary](1/2/3/3/2/1/.Outer%20Boundary) [represents the physical](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/.Physical) [or abstract limit](1/1/3/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Finite%20Limits) of a system, [delineating its separation](1/3/2/1/1/_Separation-Union) [from the external](3/1/2/3/1/1/1/.External%20testing) environment. This limit is discernible though differences in properties, physicality, or behaviors [between the system](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) and its surroundings. As an entity, [the outer boundary](1/2/3/3/2/1/.Outer%20Boundary) harnesses the potential to permit or restrict exchange in alignment with the [system's ecological demands](3/3/2/1/2/3/1/.Ecological%20Design) or capacity. Yet, [the concrete tangibility](1/1/3/1/1/2/1/2/.Concrete) [of the outer](1/2/3/3/2/1/.Outer%20Boundary) [boundary is inherently](1/2/1/1/2/3/_Boundary-Openness) fluid, continuously adapting in response to internal requirements and external pressures.
