The outer boundary represents the physical or abstract limit of a system, delineating its separation from the external environment. This limit is discernible though differences in properties, physicality, or behaviors between the system and its surroundings. As an entity, the outer boundary harnesses the potential to permit or restrict exchange in alignment with the system's ecological demands or capacity. Yet, the concrete tangibility of the outer boundary is inherently fluid, continuously adapting in response to internal requirements and external pressures.
