The inside-outside distinction, [embodied by the](3/3/.Cultural%20Embodiment) [interplay of outer](1/2/3/3/2/1/.Outer%20Boundary) [and inner boundaries](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) [along with surface](1/1/3/2/3/2/1/1/.Surface) tension, provides a [perspective to view](1/2/1/2/3/3/1/2/2/.Perspective) [the system as](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) [a self-organizing and](1/2/1/3/1/3/1/.Self-Similarity) self-maintaining entity. The proposition of what [is inside or](2/1/1/3/2/.Housing) [outside a system](1/2/3/3/2/_Inside-Outside) [fundamentally shapes the](1/1/2/2/.Change) [function and relationships](1/2/1/3/2/_Function-Inversion) within the system. Yet, this distinction [is not static](1/3/1/3/_Static-Dynamic) but highly contingent [on dynamics at](2/3/2/2/1/1/.Dynamics) play, both within [and outside the](3/2/1/2/1/1/1/_Inside-Outside) system, lending a [fluid quality to](2/1/1/2/3/.Fluidity) [the understanding of](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [what constitutes the](3/3/1/1/.Theism) ['inside' and the](3/2/1/2/1/1/1/_Inside-Outside) 'outside'.
