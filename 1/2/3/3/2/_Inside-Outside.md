The inside-outside distinction, embodied by the interplay of outer and inner boundaries along with surface tension, provides a perspective to view the system as a self-organizing and self-maintaining entity. The proposition of what is inside or outside a system fundamentally shapes the function and relationships within the system. Yet, this distinction is not static but highly contingent on dynamics at play, both within and outside the system, lending a fluid quality to the understanding of what constitutes the 'inside' and the 'outside'.
