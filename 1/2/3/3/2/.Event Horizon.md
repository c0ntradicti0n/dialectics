The Event Horizon serves as the boundary demarcating the point of no return into a singularity. Beyond this boundary, the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape, making it virtually invisible to outside observers. An event horizon draws a veil around the singularity, shielding its incomprehensible reality from our physical laws and understanding.
