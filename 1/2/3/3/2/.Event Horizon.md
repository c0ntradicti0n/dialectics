[The Event Horizon](1/1/3/1/2/1/2/.Event%20Horizon) serves as the [boundary demarcating the](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) point of no return into a singularity. Beyond this boundary, the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape, making it virtually invisible to outside observers. An [event horizon draws](1/1/3/1/2/1/2/.Event%20Horizon) [a veil around](1/2/1/3/1/3/3/1/3/.Covering) the singularity, shielding its incomprehensible reality from our physical laws and understanding.
