Space-time-mass refers to the interconnectedness of space, time, and mass in the universe. Essential to the theory of relativity, it elucidates the curvature of space-time due to mass. The concept provides interpretative and predictive tools for our understanding of powerful astrophysical phenomena, such as black holes and the expansion of the universe.
