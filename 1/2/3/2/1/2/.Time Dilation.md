Time dilation, a [corollary of Einstein's](1/2/3/2/1/.Special%20Relativity) [Special Theory of](1/3/1/1/2/2/1/1/.Electroweak%20Theory) Relativity, refers to [the phenomenon wherein](2/3/2/3/_Empirical-Theoretical) the passage of time for an object moving near [light speed is](1/3/1/1/3/3/2/.Light%20Speed) [slowed relative to](1/2/3/1/3/2/2/.Slowdown) [the rate perceived](1/2/1/3/1/1/2/3/.Perceived%20Time) by a stationary observer. This results from the concept that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, leading to variations in perceived time. In essence, space travelers [could theoretically age](1/2/2/1/2/.Age) slower than those who remained stationary, as elegantly summarized by Einstein: "Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. That's relativity." pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. That's relativity."
