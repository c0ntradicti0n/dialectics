Time dilation, a corollary of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, refers to the phenomenon wherein the passage of time for an object moving near light speed is slowed relative to the rate perceived by a stationary observer. This results from the concept that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, leading to variations in perceived time. In essence, space travelers could theoretically age slower than those who remained stationary, as elegantly summarized by Einstein: "Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. That's relativity."
