Time dilation is the phenomenon of time running more slowly in a frame of reference that's moving relative to an observer. As a predictable consequence of special relativity and the inextricable tie of time and space, it serves as empirical confirmation of general relativity. When we approach the speed of light, time ostensibly dilates, causing a moving observer's clock to register less time elapsed compared to a stationary observer's clock.
