Length contraction posits that an object moving at relativistic speeds will have its length (along the direction of motion) contracted or shortened from the perspective of stationary observers. This seemingly paradoxical outcome results due to the speed of light's invariance, causing relative deformities in scale as seen by observers in different inertial frames. For instance, a spacecraft traveling near light speed would appear shorter to stationary observers on Earth.
