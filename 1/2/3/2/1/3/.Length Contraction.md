[Length contraction posits](1/2/3/2/1/3/.Length%20Contraction) that an object [moving at relativistic](1/2/3/2/3/3/.Relative%20Velocities) speeds will have [its length (along](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/1/.Length) the direction of [motion) contracted or](1/2/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/.Time%20Contraction) shortened from the [perspective of stationary](1/2/1/2/3/3/1/2/2/.Perspective) observers. This seemingly [paradoxical outcome results](3/3/2/2/3/3/2/.Paradox) due to the [speed of light's](1/3/1/1/3/3/2/.Light%20Speed) invariance, causing relative [deformities in scale](1/2/1/3/2/3/.Scaling) as seen by [observers in different](3/3/2/3/2/3/_Performer-Observer) inertial frames. For instance, a spacecraft [traveling near light](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) [speed would appear](1/2/3/1/3/.Speed) [shorter to stationary](3/1/1/3/1/1/_Stationary-Mobile) observers on Earth.
