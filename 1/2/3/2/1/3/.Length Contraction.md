Special relativity also implies length contraction, where objects moving relative to a stationary observer shrink in the direction of motion. Linked to time dilation by the universal speed limit, the length contraction exemplifies the malleability of space and time under relativity. However, this contraction is not a "force-induced" deformation, but rather an alteration in perception owing to the synchronization of distant clocks â€” a profound reshaping of the geometry of spacetime.
