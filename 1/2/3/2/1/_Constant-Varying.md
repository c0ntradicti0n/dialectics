Fixed maximum speed, time dilation, and [length contraction collectively](1/2/3/2/1/3/.Length%20Contraction) portray a complex relationship of constant-varying. The juxtaposition lies in how the [unchanging speed of](1/2/3/2/1/_Constant-Varying) [light manifests time](1/2/2/.Time) [and space variations](1/3/1/1/3/2/2/_Space%20Distortion-Ripples) depending on the observer's motion. This [dynamic interplay between](1/2/1/1/1/1/3/3/.Dynamic%20Position) [constancy and variance](1/1/3/2/1/1/1/.Constancy) is at the heart of the relativity theory.
