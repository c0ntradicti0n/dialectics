Fixed maximum speed, time dilation, and length contraction collectively portray a complex relationship of constant-varying. The juxtaposition lies in how the unchanging speed of light manifests time and space variations depending on the observer's motion. This dynamic interplay between constancy and variance is at the heart of the relativity theory.
