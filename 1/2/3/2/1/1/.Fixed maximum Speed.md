In the realm of the physical universe, as postulated by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, there exists a fixed maximum speed, that of light in a vacuum, conventionally denoted as 'c'. This speed barrier, approximately 299,792 kilometers per second, is not simply a limitation of current technological capabilities; it is a fundamental constraint of the fabric of reality itself. This primarily suggests that no message, no matter its nature or form, can ever outpace light.
