The special theory of relativity purports the steadfast constancy of lightâ€™s velocity in vacuum being the ultimate cosmic speed limit, applied universally and unchangingly. This fixed maximum speed, denoted "C", establishes that nothing with mass can obtain this speed, only at best approaching asymptotically without ever reaching. It lays the groundwork for the relative transformation of space and time, leading to phenomena like time dilation and length contraction.
