In the realm [of the physical](1/1/3/1/1/2/1/1/.Physical) universe, as postulated [by Albert Einstein's](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) theory of relativity, [there exists a](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) fixed maximum speed, [that of light](1/3/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Light%20Waves) in a vacuum, conventionally denoted as 'c'. This speed barrier, approximately 299,792 kilometers per second, is not simply [a limitation of](2/3/1/3/1/3/.Limitation%20Boundaries) current technological capabilities; it is a [fundamental constraint of](2/3/1/3/1/3/.Limitation%20Boundaries) the fabric of reality itself. This primarily suggests that no message, no [matter its nature](1/3/1/1/2/2/1/_Matter-Forces) or form, can ever outpace light.
