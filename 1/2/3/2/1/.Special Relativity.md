Special relativity, introduced by Einstein, revolutionized the perception of space and time. It established that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion, introducing a radical departure from classical physics. It highlights the unintuitive relationships of relativity between space and time, but lacks the force of gravity, leading to the conception of general relativity.
