Special relativity, introduced by Einstein, revolutionized the perception of space and time. It established that the laws of [physics are the](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) same for all observers in uniform motion, introducing a radical departure from classical physics. It highlights the unintuitive [relationships of relativity](1/3/1/1/3/.Relativity) [between space and](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) time, but lacks the force of gravity, leading to [the conception of](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/2/.Conception) general relativity.
