Special relativity, introduced by Einstein, revolutionized [the perception of](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) space and time. [It established that](2/3/1/2/1/_Hypothesis-Proof) [the laws of](3/2/2/1/2/.Concrete%20Law) [physics are the](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) [same for all](1/2/1/1/3/_All-encompassing) [observers in uniform](3/3/2/3/2/3/_Performer-Observer) motion, introducing a [radical departure from](1/1/2/2/.Change) classical physics. It [highlights the unintuitive](3/3/2/2/3/3/.Themes%20and%20Interpretations) [relationships of relativity](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) [between space and](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) time, but lacks [the force of](1/3/1/2/1/1/3/1/.Forces) gravity, leading to [the conception of](3/3/2/2/3/3/.Themes%20and%20Interpretations) general relativity.
