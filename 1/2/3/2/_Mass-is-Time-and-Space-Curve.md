The synthesis of special and general relativity, mathematically represented through the Lorentz Transformation, exemplifies the intrinsic link between mass, time, and the curve in space-time. Mass not only creates a gravitational pull but in the vocabulary of relativity, it curves space and affects time. This unification dissolves the dichotomy between mass and energy, and between space and time, transforming our understanding of the physical world.
