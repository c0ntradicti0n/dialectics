[The synthesis of](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [special and general](1/2/1/1/3/3/1/_General-Specific) relativity, mathematically represented [through the Lorentz](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) Transformation, exemplifies the [intrinsic link between](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) mass, time, and [the curve in](1/2/1/3/3/3/2/.Curve) space-time. Mass not only creates a [gravitational pull but](1/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Gravitational%20Pull) in the vocabulary of relativity, it [curves space and](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/1/1/.Tangent%20Spaces) affects time. This [unification dissolves the](1/3/1/2/1/1/3/3/.Unification) [dichotomy between mass](1/2/3/2/_Mass-is-Time-and-Space-Curve) and energy, and [between space and](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) time, transforming our [understanding of the](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) physical world.
