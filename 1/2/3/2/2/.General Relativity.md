General relativity expands upon the principles of special relativity, accounting for the effects of gravity and acceleration. It proposes that massive objects cause a distortion in space-time, which is perceived as gravity, leading to a non-Euclidean geometry of the universe. This ground-breaking theory revolutionized the understanding of the universe but demanded a more usable tool for calculations, giving birth to the concept of Lorentz Transformation.
