[General relativity expands](1/2/3/2/2/.General%20Relativity) [upon the principles](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) of special relativity, accounting for the [effects of gravity](1/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Gravitational%20Pull) and acceleration. It proposes that massive [objects cause a](2/3/1/3/2/_Cause-Effect) distortion in space-time, which is perceived as gravity, leading [to a non-Euclidean](1/2/1/3/3/3/.Manifold) [geometry of the](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) universe. This ground-breaking [theory revolutionized the](1/2/3/2/1/.Special%20Relativity) understanding of the [universe but demanded](1/2/1/2/2/1/3/2/.Metaphysical%20Queries) a more usable tool for calculations, giving birth to [the concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) Lorentz Transformation.
