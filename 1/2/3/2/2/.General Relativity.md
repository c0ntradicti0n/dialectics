[General relativity expands](1/3/1/1/3/2/.General%20Relativity) [upon the principles](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) of special relativity, [accounting for the](2/1/1/3/3/2/2/.Analyzing) [effects of gravity](1/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Gravitational%20Pull) and acceleration. It [proposes that massive](1/2/3/2/2/_Massive-Massless) [objects cause a](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/3/_Cause-Effect) distortion in space-time, [which is perceived](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) as gravity, leading [to a non-Euclidean](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) [geometry of the](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) universe. This ground-breaking [theory revolutionized the](1/2/3/2/1/.Special%20Relativity) [understanding of the](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [universe but demanded](3/1/3/3/2/3/2/2/.Demand) [a more usable](1/3/3/2/1/1/_Abrlative-Reusable) tool for calculations, [giving birth to](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/2/3/.Birth) [the concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) Lorentz Transformation.
