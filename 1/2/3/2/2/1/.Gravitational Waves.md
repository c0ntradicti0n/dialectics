In the domain of general relativity, [gravitational waves stand](1/3/1/1/3/2/2/.Gravitational%20Waves) [as ripples propagating](1/3/1/1/3/2/2/_Space%20Distortion-Ripples) [in spacetime resulting](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) from accelerating masses. When massive bodies move, their gravitational [effects ripple through](1/1/3/3/3/3/3/.Effect) [spacetime like waves](1/3/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Light%20Waves) on a pond, albeit at a speed equal to light's. Direct detection [of these waves](1/3/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Light%20Waves) [by LIGO and](3/1/3/2/1/2/2/2/.Cooperative%20Games) [Virgo collaborations affirm](3/3/3/3/3/3/1/1/_Companion-Star) Einstein's century-old prediction, unveiling an entirely [new observational avenue](2/2/3/3/1/1/.Observation) to investigate and comprehend the universe.
