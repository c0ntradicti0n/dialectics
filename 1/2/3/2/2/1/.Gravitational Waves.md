In the domain of general relativity, gravitational waves stand as ripples propagating in spacetime resulting from accelerating masses. When massive bodies move, their gravitational effects ripple through spacetime like waves on a pond, albeit at a speed equal to light's. Direct detection of these waves by LIGO and Virgo collaborations affirm Einstein's century-old prediction, unveiling an entirely new observational avenue to investigate and comprehend the universe.
