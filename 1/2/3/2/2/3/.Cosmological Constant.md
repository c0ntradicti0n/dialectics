Dubbed Einstein's "greatest blunder", the cosmological constant arose from Einstein's attempt to reconcile general relativity with a static universe, but was discarded after the discovery of cosmic expansionâ€”only to be reinstated to explain cosmic acceleration. This pervasive energy density, associated with the quantum vacuum, now labeled "dark energy", accounts for nearly 70% of the universe's energy content, posing both the biggest mystery and piece in the cosmological puzzle.
