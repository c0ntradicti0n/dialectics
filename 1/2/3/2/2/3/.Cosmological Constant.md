[Dubbed Einstein's "greatest](1/2/1/3/1/1/3/2/1/.Einstein-Rosen%20Bridges) blunder", the cosmological constant arose from [Einstein's attempt to](1/2/3/2/1/.Special%20Relativity) [reconcile general relativity](1/2/3/2/2/.General%20Relativity) with a static universe, but was discarded after the [discovery of cosmic](1/2/1/2/1/2/2/.Cosmic%20Vacuum) expansionâ€”only to be reinstated to explain cosmic acceleration. This pervasive energy density, associated with the quantum vacuum, now labeled "dark energy", accounts for nearly 70% of the universe's energy content, posing both the [biggest mystery and](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) piece in the cosmological puzzle.
