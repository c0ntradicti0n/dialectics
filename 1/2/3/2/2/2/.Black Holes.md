From the mathematical foretelling of solutions to Einstein's field equations to direct imaging in the 21st century, black holes have transitioned from theoretical curiosity to astronomical reality. These regions of spacetime, from which nothing, not even light, can escape, underscore the extreme contortions of gravitation, confounding our intuitions about spacetime, and yet, they serve as crucial testing grounds for our understanding of gravitational physics.
