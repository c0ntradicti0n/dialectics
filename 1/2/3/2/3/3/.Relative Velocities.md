Although in classical physics, relative velocities of two bodies simply add up, in special relativity, they abide by a more complex law. Approach or exceedance of the speed of light isn't permissible by mere addition thus, the relativistic addition formula comes into play. This frames the relation of velocities in a way that preserves the universality of the speed of light, embodying the constancy-varying dialectic in relativistic kinematics.
