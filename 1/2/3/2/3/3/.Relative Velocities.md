Relative velocities cater to the translational motion between observer and observable. In a relativistic setting, such velocities cannot simply be added or subtracted algebraically but need to be computed through Einstein's velocity transformation formula. This ensures velocities never exceed the speed of light, reinforcing c's fixed maximum status.
