[Relative velocities cater](1/2/3/2/3/3/.Relative%20Velocities) to the translational [motion between observer](1/3/1/1/3/1/1/_Rest-Moving%20Observer) and observable. In a relativistic setting, [such velocities cannot](1/2/3/2/3/3/.Relative%20Velocities) simply be added [or subtracted algebraically](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/1/3/3/.Set%20Minus) but need to be computed through [Einstein's velocity transformation](1/3/1/1/3/1/1/.Lorentz%20Transformations) formula. This ensures [velocities never exceed](1/2/3/2/3/3/.Relative%20Velocities) [the speed of](1/3/1/1/3/3/2/.Light%20Speed) light, reinforcing c's fixed maximum status.
