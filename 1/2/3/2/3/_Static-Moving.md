Lorentz Factor, Spacetime intervals, and Relative [velocities epitomize the](1/1/3/2/1/2/1/.Velocity) static-moving dialectic. The [Lorentz Factor represents](1/2/3/2/3/1/.Lorentz%20Factor) [a static transformation](2/2/2/1/3/3/2/_Rigid-Flexible%20Transformation) [rule for dynamic](3/1/1/3/2/3/_Pre-defined-Dynamic) [effects of time](1/2/2/.Time) [dilation and length](1/2/3/2/1/3/.Length%20Contraction) contraction. Spacetime intervals [symbolize the static](1/3/1/3/_Static-Dynamic) backdrop against which all events are traced. The concept [of relative velocity](1/2/3/2/3/3/.Relative%20Velocities) portrays the unceasing [movement of entities](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) [in this static](1/1/3/1/1/2/1/.Tangible) canvas of spacetime.
