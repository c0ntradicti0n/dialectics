Lorentz Factor, Spacetime intervals, and Relative velocities epitomize the static-moving dialectic. The Lorentz Factor represents a static transformation rule for dynamic effects of time dilation and length contraction. Spacetime intervals symbolize the static backdrop against which all events are traced. The concept of relative velocity portrays the unceasing movement of entities in this static canvas of spacetime.
