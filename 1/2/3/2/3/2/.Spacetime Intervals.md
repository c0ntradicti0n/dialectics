The concept of spacetime intervals elucidates the consistency underlying relativistic physics. While spatial distance and temporal duration may differ for different observers, the spacetime interval between two events—an amalgam of space and time separation—is invariant. This interval is the "distance" in spacetime, the only common measurement in a universe where space contracts and time dilutes.
