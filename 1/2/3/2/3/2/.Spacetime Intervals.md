In the framework of Special Relativity, events are inscribed into a four-dimensional tractor called Spacetime. Spacetime intervals, the spacetime equivalent of earthly distances, remain invariant across all inertial frames. These intervals, composed of three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension, lay the basis for the space-time continuum structure.
