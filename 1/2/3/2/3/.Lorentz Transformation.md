The Lorentz Transformation, derived from the principles of special relativity, provides mathematical formulas for translating between different inertial frames. It describes the relationship between the quantities measured by two observers in relative motion. This transformation encapsulates the relative nature of space and time and the conversion between mass and energy, uniting special and general relativity.
