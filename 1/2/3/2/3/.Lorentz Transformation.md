The Lorentz Transformation, [derived from the](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/3/1/_Origin-Derivation) [principles of special](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) relativity, provides mathematical [formulas for translating](1/2/1/3/2/2/.Translation) [between different inertial](1/3/1/1/3/1/_Inertial-Relative) frames. It describes [the relationship between](1/3/1/3/1/3/.Ecological%20Relationships) [the quantities measured](2/3/1/2/3/.Measurement) [by two observers](3/3/2/3/2/3/_Performer-Observer) in relative motion. [This transformation encapsulates](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) [the relative nature](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) [of space and](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) [time and the](1/2/2/.Time) [conversion between mass](1/1/3/2/1/2/3/1/.Mass%20x%20Velocity) and energy, uniting [special and general](2/2/3/1/1/_General-Specific) relativity.
