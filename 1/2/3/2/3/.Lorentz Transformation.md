The Lorentz Transformation, derived from the [principles of special](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) relativity, provides mathematical [formulas for translating](1/2/1/1/2/1/3/1/.Translation) [between different inertial](1/3/1/1/3/1/_Inertial-Relative) frames. It describes the relationship between [the quantities measured](1/2/1/2/3/1/3/.Measurement) [by two observers](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) in relative motion. [This transformation encapsulates](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) [the relative nature](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) [of space and](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) time and the [conversion between mass](1/1/3/2/1/2/3/1/.Mass%20x%20Velocity) and energy, uniting special and general relativity.
