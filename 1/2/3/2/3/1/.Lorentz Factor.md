In relativistic physics, the Lorentz factor is paramount in reconciling pre-relativistic concepts of time, length, and energy with the relativistic universe's realities. Rooted in the speed of light's invariance, the Lorentz factor dictates the relativistic increase of mass, the dilation of time, and the contraction of length. Thus, it embodies the affine relationship between different inertial frames, providing the metric for spacetime transformations.
