At the intersection [of length contraction](1/2/3/2/1/3/.Length%20Contraction) [and time dilation](1/2/3/2/1/2/.Time%20Dilation) [lies the Lorentz](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) Factor, denoted by γ (gamma). It [quantifies the effect](1/1/3/3/3/3/3/.Effect) [of relativistic speed](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) on time and space measurements. As [the speed of](1/3/1/1/3/3/2/.Light%20Speed) light's constancy dictates, [the Lorentz Factor](1/2/3/2/3/1/.Lorentz%20Factor) [varies according to](3/2/2/1/1/3/.Severity%20of%20Offense) [an object's relative](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.Relative%20Complement) speed, with γ taking a value of 1 for [stationary objects and](3/1/1/3/1/1/_Stationary-Mobile) [approaching infinity for](1/1/3/2/3/3/2/3/2/.Infinite%20Limits) [objects nearing light](1/3/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Light%20Waves) speed.
