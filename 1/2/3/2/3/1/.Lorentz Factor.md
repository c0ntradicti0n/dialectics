At the intersection of length contraction and time dilation lies the Lorentz Factor, denoted by γ (gamma). It quantifies the effect of relativistic speed on time and space measurements. As the speed of light's constancy dictates, the Lorentz Factor varies according to an object's relative speed, with γ taking a value of 1 for stationary objects and approaching infinity for objects nearing light speed.
