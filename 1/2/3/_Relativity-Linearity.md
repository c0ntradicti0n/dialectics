"Relativity-Linearity" is a relational concept accentuating the profound break from classical mechanics' linear perspective and the advent of physics' relativistic view. It acknowledges space-time's inherent curvature due to mass under relativity theory, countering the simplistic linear progression of absolute space-time in previous scientific understanding.
