Space and time, although distinct concepts, are interconnected. The framework of placement combines both space and time, giving rise to the concept of space-time. Space-time provides the four-dimensional framework in which objects and events exist and interact. It allows us to understand how the position and motion of objects change over time and how the temporal ordering of events affects their spatial relationships.
