Space-time is the conceptual framework that combines the dimensions of space and time into a unified continuum. It is a foundational concept in physics and provides the basis for understanding the behavior of objects and events in the physical world. Space-time allows for the description of the interplay between spatial dimensions and temporal progression, enabling us to study phenomena such as motion, gravity, and the behavior of light.
