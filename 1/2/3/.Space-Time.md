Space-time is a fused unity of space and time, a four-dimensional fabric of the universe where all events take place. In this concept, space and time are not distinct but interconnected and interdependent. The differentiation of space coordinates and the progression of time form the fabric upon which physical events occur. However, while space-time acknowledges the physical reality of both time and space, it lacks the ability to account for higher dimensions, hinting at a further dialectical development.
