Space and time, though conceptually distinct, [are deeply intertwined](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) [in the fabric](3/1/1/1/1/2/1/3/3/1/.Cotton) of the universe. [This union is](3/2/3/1/3/3/1/.Trade%20Unions) often termed space-time, [a four-dimensional continuum](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/3/.Cardinal%20Continuum) [where events are](1/2/2/3/3/1/.Event) [located not just](2/1/3/2/2/1/2/.Place) [in space but](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) also in time. [The intertwining means](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) [that neither can](1/1/3/2/1/1/3/1/.Unchangeability) [be considered in](3/2/2/1/1/2/1/2/1/3/.Solicitation) [isolation from the](1/3/1/3/3/3/1/.Geographical%20Isolation) other; any event [in the universe](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) [is defined by](2/2/3/2/1/3/.Interpretation) [its position in](3/3/2/3/1/1/2/.Second%20Position) [space and its](1/2/1/.Space) moment in time. Moreover, the relationship [between space and](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) [time is affected](1/2/2/.Time) [by factors like](2/3/1/3/2/2/.Multicausal%20Factors) speed and gravity. For instance, as [theorized by Einstein's](1/3/1/1/3/.Relativity) Relativity, the faster an object moves, [the slower its](1/2/3/1/3/.Speed) [experience of time](1/2/2/.Time) [relative to a](1/3/1/1/3/3/_Relative-Absolute) stationary observer. This [dynamic and relative](2/3/1/2/2/_Static-Dynamic) [nature of space-time](1/2/3/.Space-Time) challenges our traditional, [absolute conceptions of](2/3/1/3/3/2/.Unfalsifiable%20Concepts) space and time.
