Space and time, though conceptually distinct, are deeply intertwined in the fabric of the universe. This union is often termed space-time, a four-dimensional continuum where events are located not just in space but also in time. The intertwining means that neither can be considered in isolation from the other; any event in the universe is defined by its position in space and its moment in time. Moreover, the relationship between space and time is affected by factors like speed and gravity. For instance, as theorized by Einstein's Relativity, the faster an object moves, the slower its experience of time relative to a stationary observer. This dynamic and relative nature of space-time challenges our traditional, absolute conceptions of space and time. experience of time relative to a stationary observer.
