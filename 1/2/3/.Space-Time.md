Space and time, though conceptually distinct, [are deeply intertwined](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) in the fabric of the universe. This union is often termed space-time, [a four-dimensional continuum](1/2/1/1/1/1/2/2/.One-Dimensional) where events are [located not just](1/2/1/2/3/1/2/3/.Location) [in space but](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) also in time. [The intertwining means](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) that neither can be considered in isolation from the other; any event [in the universe](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) [is defined by](2/2/3/2/1/3/.Interpretation) [its position in](3/3/2/3/1/1/2/.Second%20Position) [space and its](1/2/1/.Space) moment in time. Moreover, the relationship [between space and](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) [time is affected](1/2/3/2/1/2/.Time%20Dilation) by factors like speed and gravity. For instance, as [theorized by Einstein's](1/3/1/1/3/.Relativity) Relativity, the faster an object moves, the slower its experience of time relative to a stationary observer. This dynamic and relative nature of space-time challenges our traditional, absolute conceptions of space and time.

This [dynamic and relative](1/2/1/1/1/1/3/3/.Dynamic%20Position) [nature of space-time](1/2/3/.Space-Time) challenges our traditional, [absolute conceptions of](2/3/1/3/3/2/.Unfalsifiable%20Concepts) space and time.
