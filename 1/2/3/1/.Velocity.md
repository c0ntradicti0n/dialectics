[Velocity is a](1/2/1/1/2/1/2/2/.Velocity) [physical vector quantity](1/2/1/2/3/2/.Vector) [representing the rate](1/1/3/2/3/3/3/2/2/.Rate%20to%20Quantity) of change of [an object's position](1/2/1/1/1/1/3/2/.Relative%20Position) [as it moves](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) [through space with](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) a specific direction. It plays a crucial role in [understanding and predicting](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) physical phenomena, including astronomical events, as [it links space](1/2/1/3/3/3/3/.Space) and time into a single entity: space-time.
