The framework of placement is the spatial-temporal context in which things exist and events occur. It is the foundational structure in which properties, relationships, and relative positions are understood. Such a framework is essential because without it, the placement, arrangement, and even movement of things would be inconceivable. It defines not just where, but also when, acting as a reference for understanding causality, progression, and regression.
