A posteriori, in contrast to a priori, is knowledge gained through sensory experience and empirical evidence. This antithesis acknowledges the contingent nature of much of our understanding, which relies on experiential observation and empirical validation. The a posteriori approach lays stress on the empirical validity of knowledge, emphasizing the role of experience and observation in knowledge formation.
