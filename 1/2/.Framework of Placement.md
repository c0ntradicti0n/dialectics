[The framework of](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/.Frameworks) [placement is the](1/2/1/2/3/1/2/2/.Position) [spatial-temporal context in](1/2/.Framework%20of%20Placement) which things exist and events occur. It is the [foundational structure in](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) which properties, relationships, [and relative positions](1/2/1/1/1/1/3/2/.Relative%20Position) are understood. Such [a framework is](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/.Frameworks) essential because without it, the placement, arrangement, and even [movement of things](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) would be inconceivable. It defines not just where, but also when, acting as a reference for understanding causality, progression, and regression.
