Vectors, accounting for [both magnitude and](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/1/3/.Magnitude) direction, stand on contradiction with scalars. [A vector does](1/2/1/1/2/1/2/.Vector) [not just represent](3/2/3/3/2/2/.Representative%20Democracy) a quantity, it also stipulates movement, inclining toward a specific orientation. This [makes vectors fundamental](1/2/1/2/3/2/.Vector) in expressing transformations, velocities or forces, [wherein direction is](1/1/3/2/1/2/1/2/.Direction) as critical as magnitude. As such, [vectors echo the](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/2/2/.Vector) [physical world more](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/.Physical) robustly than scalars, [embodying movement and](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) dynamism. But vectors in isolation do [not portray multilinear](1/2/1/3/1/2/2/_Line-Plane) relationships present in most physical systems, which brings us [to the concept](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) of matrices.
