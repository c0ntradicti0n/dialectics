Vectors, accounting for both magnitude and direction, stand on contradiction with scalars. A vector does not just represent a quantity, it also stipulates movement, inclining toward a specific orientation. This makes vectors fundamental in expressing transformations, velocities or forces, wherein direction is as critical as magnitude. As such, vectors echo the physical world more robustly than scalars, embodying movement and dynamism. But vectors in isolation do not portray multilinear relationships present in most physical systems, which brings us to the concept of matrices.
