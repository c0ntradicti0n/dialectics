A matrix extends the concepts of scalar and vector to interpolate a system of simultaneous linear equations or to represent a transformation in a multivariate space. A matrix is a compendium of numbers sorted in rows and columns, each element possibly being the manifestation of a scalar or a vector, manifesting a multi-dimensionally structured form. Matrices form the backbone of crucial operations in mathematics and physics such as rotation, scaling or transformation, highlighting their role in engendering structure-multilinearity.
