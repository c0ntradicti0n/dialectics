Structure-Multilinearity emerges as the synthesis of scalar, vector, and matrix. It represents the interplay between individual, directed, and interrelated elements of a system, allowing us to perceive the multi-faceted dynamics of composite physical and abstract systems. Structure-multilinearity encapsulates the constancy of a scalar, the directionality of a vector, and the multi-linear relationships of a matrix, evolving a robust framework for depicting and managing real-world phenomena.
