Geometry, originating from the ancient Greek words for earth and measurement, is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, and solids. While it deals with ideal, abstract shapes and forms, geometry has its practical applications in the physical world, guiding the layout of fields and cities, the construction of buildings, the navigation of seafarers, and much more. The exactness of geometric calculations, however, may not perfectly capture the irregularities and anomalies found in the natural and man-made world.
