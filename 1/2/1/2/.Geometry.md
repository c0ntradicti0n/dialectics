Geometry is the mathematical discipline that investigates the properties and relationships of points, lines, and shapes in space. It provides a formal framework for understanding the structure and behavior of spatial entities. Geometry encompasses concepts such as distance, angles, and proportions, enabling us to analyze and describe the geometric properties of objects within a given spatial context.
