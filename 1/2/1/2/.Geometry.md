[Geometry is the](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) study of shape, size, the properties of space, and relationships between objects. A mathematical order, [fundamental in understanding](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) the physical world. [It provides a](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/3/3/.Community%20Benefits) [clear model for](2/3/1/3/_Model-Reality) defining phenomena, from [basic line and](1/2/1/2/1/3/3/2/.Line) [plane to intricate](1/2/1/1/1/2/.Plane) shapes and dimensions. [Geometry forms the](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) [foundation for switching](3/1/1/1/2/3/2/.Switches) dimensions in science, [as it articulates](3/3/2/_Expression-Observation) [the rules and](3/1/3/2/1/1/1/.Rules) [parameters within which](2/3/1/1/2/1/.Criteria) dimensions operate.
