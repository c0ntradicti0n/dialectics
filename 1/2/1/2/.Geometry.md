Geometry is the study of shape, size, the properties of space, and relationships between objects. A mathematical order, fundamental in understanding the physical world. It provides a clear model for defining phenomena, from basic line and plane to intricate shapes and dimensions. Geometry forms the foundation for switching dimensions in science, as it articulates the rules and parameters within which dimensions operate.
