A void represents absolute emptiness, fundamentally a vacuum but elevating the absence of materiality to an ontological notion of complete absence. However, it still reaffirms the robustness of space, albeit in a negative form, for the void itself is a spatial concept that hinges on the perception of an absolute absence in a otherwise existent space.
