Nullity is the quality of being null or nonexistent, embodying an ultimate state of non-being. It transcends the spatial characteristics of a vacuum or the ontological emptiness inherent in a void, to render an absolute zero, an absence that effaces itself. It is the negation of even the nonexistence, signifying a paradoxical 'existence' without being.
