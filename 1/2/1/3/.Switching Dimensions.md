[Switching dimensions refers](1/2/1/3/.Switching%20Dimensions) [to navigating between](3/1/1/3/3/3/2/3/.Obstacle%20Navigation%20Algorithms) [various spatial levels](3/1/1/2/3/1/1/1/_Spatial-Hierarchical) of conceptual and physical entities. It ranges from simple [one-dimensional lines to](1/2/1/3/1/2/2/_Line-Plane) [complex multidimensional spaces](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/3/.Complex%20Manifolds) in theoretical physics. [Understanding the intricate](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [rules of geometry](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) [facilitates transitioning across](1/2/1/1/1/3/2/2/.Transition%20Maps) dimensions, illuminating phenomena that exist outside of our intuitive perception of reality.
