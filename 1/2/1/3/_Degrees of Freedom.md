[The degrees of](1/2/1/2/3/1/1/3/.Degree) [freedom in a](3/3/2/2/3/3/3/.Interpretive%20Freedom) [system are defined](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) as the minimum number of independent [coordinates that can](1/2/1/1/1/1/1/.Coordinates) specify the position of the system. In the context of dimensions, transformations, and topology, degrees [of freedom could](3/3/2/2/3/3/3/.Interpretive%20Freedom) be considered as [the variable entities](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) that are free [to change within](1/1/2/2/.Change) [the constraints of](2/3/1/3/1/3/.Limitation%20Boundaries) the system. They [represent a synthesis](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [of dimensions and](3/2/2/3/1/.Dimensions) transformations, reflected in [the topology of](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/1/.Topological%20Spaces) a space. This allows for the [emergence of complexity](2/3/1/3/2/3/.Complexity%20Theories) and variety, while still being framed within the parameters of the system.
