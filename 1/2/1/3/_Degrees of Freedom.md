The degrees of freedom in a system are defined as the minimum number of independent coordinates that can specify the position of the system. In the context of dimensions, transformations, and topology, degrees of freedom could be considered as the variable entities that are free to change within the constraints of the system. They represent a synthesis of dimensions and transformations, reflected in the topology of a space. This allows for the emergence of complexity and variety, while still being framed within the parameters of the system.
