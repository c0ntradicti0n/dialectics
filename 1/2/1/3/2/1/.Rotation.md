In physical systems, [rotation refers to](1/2/1/1/2/1/3/2/.Rotation) [the movement around](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) an axis. Itâ€™s [a transformation that](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) necessitates no change in the object's position or size, only its orientation. [A rotating body](1/2/1/3/1/2/2/2/3/.Rotation) [experiences a continuance](2/2/1/2/3/3/.Lasting) of states rather than an absolute state at any instant, subtly echoing the state of becoming. However, rotation in isolation oversimplifies the complexities of physical interactions, paving the way for understanding translation.
