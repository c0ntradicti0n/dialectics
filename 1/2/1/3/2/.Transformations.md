Transformations describe a change in the state of a system or an object from one set of conditions to another, often through the application of some kind of force or influence. In the context of dimensions, transformations could include shifts, rotations, and scale changes, referred to as translation, rotation, and dilation respectively. These alterations do not affect the intrinsic properties of a figure but change its orientation or location in the dimensional space.
