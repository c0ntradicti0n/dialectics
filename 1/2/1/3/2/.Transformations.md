[Transformations describe a](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) [change in the](1/1/3/2/3/1/3/1/.Change) state of a system or an object from one set of conditions to another, often through the application of some kind of force or influence. In the context of dimensions, [transformations could include](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) shifts, rotations, and scale changes, referred to as translation, rotation, and dilation respectively. These alterations do not affect the intrinsic properties [of a figure](1/2/1/3/3/1/2/.Figure-Eight) but change its orientation or location [in the dimensional](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/.One%20Dimension) space.
