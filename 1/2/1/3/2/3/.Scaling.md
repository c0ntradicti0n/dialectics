Scaling, the process of expanding or [compressing the size](1/2/1/2/1/1/2/1/.Compressed) of an object, provides the third [critical element in](1/1/3/2/2/3/2/3/.Neutral%20element%20e) understanding geometric transformations. [Scaling can change](1/2/1/2/3/3/1/1/2/.Scaling) [an object's size](1/2/1/3/2/3/.Scaling) without affecting its shape or orientation, [suggesting a transformation](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) that doesnâ€™t alter the nature of the object. Together, rotation, translation, and [scaling form the](1/2/1/1/2/1/3/3/.Scaling) cornerstone of most [transformations in mathematics](1/2/1/3/2/.Transformations) and physics.
