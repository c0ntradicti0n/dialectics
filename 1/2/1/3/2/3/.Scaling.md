Scaling, the process of expanding or compressing the size of an object, provides the third critical element in understanding geometric transformations. Scaling can change an object's size without affecting its shape or orientation, suggesting a transformation that doesnâ€™t alter the nature of the object. Together, rotation, translation, and scaling form the cornerstone of most transformations in mathematics and physics.
