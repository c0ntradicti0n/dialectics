Translation represents linear motion along a path, moving an object from one location to another without altering its orientation or size. It symbolizes a change in position, a state to state transition which emulates into a directional process. Although rotation and translation provide an exhaustive view of rigid body movements, scaling gives us insight into transformation regarding the size of the object.
