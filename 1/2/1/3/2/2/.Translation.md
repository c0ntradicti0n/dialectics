[Translation represents linear](1/2/1/3/2/2/.Translation) [motion along a](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) path, moving an object from one location to another without altering its orientation or size. [It symbolizes a](3/1/1/2/1/_Signifier-Signified) change in position, a state to [state transition which](1/2/1/1/1/3/2/2/.Transition%20Maps) emulates into a directional process. Although [rotation and translation](1/2/1/3/2/1/.Rotation) provide an exhaustive [view of rigid](2/2/2/1/3/3/2/_Rigid-Flexible%20Transformation) body movements, scaling gives us insight [into transformation regarding](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) the size of the object.
