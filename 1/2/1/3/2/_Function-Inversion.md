[Function and its](1/2/1/3/2/_Function-Inversion) [inversion form a](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/1/2/2/.Inversions) [dialectical pair where](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) [the function signifies](1/2/1/3/2/_Function-Inversion) [a transformation from](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) an input to an output, and [the inversion implies](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/1/2/2/.Inversions) [the reversal of](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/1/2/2/.Inversions) this process. When perceived with rotation, translation, and scaling, they provide a comprehensive understanding of transformations. As the [philosopher Bertrand Russell](3/3/2/3/3/1/.Classical%20Foundations) eloquently states, "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty [â€” a beauty](2/2/2/2/1/_Ugly-Beautiful) cold and austere, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music." Function-inversion allows for the [aesthetic and exploratory](2/2/2/2/.Aesthetics) traversal through the phenomenological world, continually oscillating between creation and undoing, transformation, and its reversal.
