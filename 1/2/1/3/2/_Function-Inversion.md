Function and its inversion form a dialectical pair where the function signifies a transformation from an input to an output, and the inversion implies the reversal of this process. When perceived with rotation, translation, and scaling, they provide a comprehensive understanding of transformations. As the philosopher Bertrand Russell eloquently states, "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty â€” a beauty cold and austere, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music." Function-inversion allows for the aesthetic and exploratory traversal through the phenomenological world, continually oscillating between creation and undoing, transformation, and its reversal.
