Contrasting to the temporal dimension, spatial dimensions - length, width, and depth - encompass directionality. They demarcate the expanse within which all physical entities exist and events occur. Unlike time, which remains sequential and unidirectional, space invites movement in any direction and, hence, is observed as a collection of vectors. However, real-world systems often exhibit dimensions that are not strictly temporal or spatial, birthing the concept of fractal dimensions.
