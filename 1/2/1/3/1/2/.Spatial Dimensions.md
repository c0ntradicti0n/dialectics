Contrasting to the temporal dimension, spatial dimensions - length, width, and depth - encompass directionality. [They demarcate the](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/1/2/.Separation%20Marks) expanse within which [all physical entities](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/.Physical) exist and events occur. Unlike time, which remains sequential and unidirectional, space invites movement in any direction and, hence, is observed as a collection of vectors. However, real-world systems often [exhibit dimensions that](3/2/2/3/1/.Dimensions) are not strictly temporal or spatial, birthing the concept of fractal dimensions.
