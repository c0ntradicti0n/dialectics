[Dimensions are fundamental](1/2/1/3/1/.Dimensions) [aspects of the](2/3/3/3/1/3/2/2/.Sociocultural%20Aspects) [natural world that](3/3/2/2/2/1/1/.Nature%20Cycles) [provide the spatial](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Spatial) [and temporal context](3/3/2/2/.Narrative%20Shapes) [within which physical](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/.Physical) phenomena occur. They [are modes of](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/1/3/3/.Cycle%20Types) [measurement defining a](1/2/1/2/3/1/3/.Measurement) framework that is integral to the [description and understanding](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [of our physical](1/1/3/1/1/2/1/1/.Physical) reality. Their nature and number have been subject to philosophical debate but fundamentally, they are [the coordinates in](1/2/1/1/1/1/1/.Coordinates) [a Cartesian system](1/2/1/1/1/2/1/.Cartesian%20Plane) that allow to point, measure and [represent entities and](1/1/3/1/1/2/3/.Representational) events in our world.
