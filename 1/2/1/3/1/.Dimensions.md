Dimensions are fundamental aspects of the natural world that provide the spatial and temporal context within which physical phenomena occur. They are modes of measurement defining a framework that is integral to the description and understanding of our physical reality. Their nature and number have been subject to philosophical debate but fundamentally, they are the coordinates in a Cartesian system that allow to point, measure and represent entities and events in our world.
