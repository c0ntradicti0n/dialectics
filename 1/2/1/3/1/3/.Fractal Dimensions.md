[A fractal dimension](1/2/1/3/1/3/3/.Fractal%20Dimensionality) is a synthesis of temporal and spatial dimensions. Fractals [encapsulate patterns that](1/1/2/3/3/.Pattern) recur at progressively smaller scales, signifying [complex systems and](1/2/1/1/1/3/3/3/.Complex%20Structure) scenarios that donâ€™t conform strictly to the integer dimensions. [Fractal dimensions capture](1/2/1/3/1/3/3/.Fractal%20Dimensionality) the intricacies of the physical world, from natural forms to dynamic systems, which are otherwise impossible to describe in the traditional [spatial or temporal](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Spatial) dimensions. This brings us to the interplay between continuity [and discreteness in](1/1/3/1/1/.Discrete) dimensions.
