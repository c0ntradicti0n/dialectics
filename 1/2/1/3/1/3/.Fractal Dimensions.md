A fractal dimension is a synthesis of temporal and spatial dimensions. Fractals encapsulate patterns that recur at progressively smaller scales, signifying complex systems and scenarios that donâ€™t conform strictly to the integer dimensions. Fractal dimensions capture the intricacies of the physical world, from natural forms to dynamic systems, which are otherwise impossible to describe in the traditional spatial or temporal dimensions. This brings us to the interplay between continuity and discreteness in dimensions.
