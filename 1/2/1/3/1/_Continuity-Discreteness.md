Continuity and discreteness form an antinomic pair in dimensions. While a continuous dimension offers an infinite number of possible states, a discrete dimension has distinct, countable states. Temporal and spatial dimensions can be perceived as both continuous and discrete depending on their representation. On the other hand, fractal dimension with its complex, non-integer values challenges this dichotomy, unlocking a new perspective in dimensional analysis.
