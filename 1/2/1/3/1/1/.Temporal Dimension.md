Our perception of time typifies the essence of the temporal dimension. Itâ€™s scalar in nature, with no physical direction but a sense of progression, from past to future. Time provides a structure and sequence, catalogs experiences, and initializes changes, dictating the rhythm of existence. The unidirectional flow of the temporal dimension characteristically contradicts the nature of spatial dimensions, where there exists a bidirectional freedom.
