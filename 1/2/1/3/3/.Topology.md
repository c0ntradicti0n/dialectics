Topology, as a branch of mathematics, deals with the properties of space that remain unchanged under continuous transformations. It focuses on concepts of closeness, continuity, and limit, going beyond our traditional sense of geometry to examine the 'rubber sheet geometry' of objects. Thus, topology can be seen as a 'meta-dimension', a broader, more abstract structure in which the dimensions and transformations can take place.
