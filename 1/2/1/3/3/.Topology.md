Topology, as a branch of mathematics, [deals with the](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/.Communication) [properties of space](1/2/1/1/1/.Space) [that remain unchanged](2/2/3/2/3/3/.Change%20and%20Permanence) under continuous transformations. [It focuses on](2/1/2/3/2/1/.Deficit%20Focus) concepts of closeness, continuity, and limit, [going beyond our](2/3/3/.Human%20Endeavors) [traditional sense of](2/3/2/1/.Traditions) [geometry to examine](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) [the 'rubber sheet](3/1/1/1/1/2/3/2/2/2/.Crepe%20Rubber) geometry' of objects. Thus, topology can [be seen as](3/1/3/1/3/1/_See-Unseen) a 'meta-dimension', a broader, more abstract [structure in which](1/1/3/3/1/2/2/.Structure) [the dimensions and](3/2/2/3/1/.Dimensions) [transformations can take](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) place.
