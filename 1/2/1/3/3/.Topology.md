Topology, as a branch of mathematics, deals with the [properties of space](1/2/1/1/1/.Space) that remain unchanged under continuous transformations. It focuses on concepts of closeness, continuity, and limit, going beyond our traditional sense of [geometry to examine](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) the 'rubber sheet geometry' of objects. Thus, topology can be seen as a 'meta-dimension', a broader, more abstract [structure in which](1/1/3/3/1/2/2/.Structure) [the dimensions and](1/2/1/3/1/3/3/2/2/.Box%20Size) [transformations can take](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) place.
