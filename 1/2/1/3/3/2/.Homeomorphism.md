Homeomorphism, widely known in mathematics, illustrates [the concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) [morphic resonance between](1/3/1/2/2/2/1/3/.Resonance) two topological spaces, without any change [to the internal](3/2/1/2/1/1/1/_Inside-Outside) structure. It allows [two objects to](3/1/1/2/3/3/2/3/_Object-Instance) [be deformed into](3/3/3/_Manifestation-Transformation) each other through bending, stretching or compressing while preserving their essential properties. As a great philosopher, Rene Descartes, used to say, "it is not enough to have a good mind; the main thing is to use it well." This [idea expands our](2/3/1/1/1/1/.Idea) understanding of the flexibility of space, [transcending concrete forms](1/1/2/3/_Abstraction%20of%20concrete) and shapes.
