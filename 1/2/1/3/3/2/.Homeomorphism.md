Homeomorphism, widely known in mathematics, illustrates the concept of morphic resonance between two topological spaces, without any change to the internal structure. It allows two objects to be deformed into each other through bending, stretching or compressing while preserving their essential properties. As a great philosopher, Rene Descartes, used to say, "it is not enough to have a good mind; the main thing is to use it well." This idea expands our understanding of the flexibility of space, transcending concrete forms and shapes.
