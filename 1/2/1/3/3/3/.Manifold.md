In addressing Manifold, [an entity that](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) might seem locally [Euclidean but encompasses](1/2/1/3/3/3/.Manifold) a larger, non-Euclidean, [complex structure we](1/2/1/1/1/3/3/3/.Complex%20Structure) [understand the labyrinthine](1/2/1/1/1/3/.Manifold) nature of space. [Manifolds guide us](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/.Manifolds) [through the curved](1/2/1/3/1/2/2/3/_Flat-Curved) [trajectories within space](1/3/3/1/.Orbital%20Mechanics) and time, bringing [an understanding of](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [phenomena from physics](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) to cosmology. Manifold captures the sentiment of Arthur C. Clarke: "Magic's just [science that we](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) don't understand yet."
