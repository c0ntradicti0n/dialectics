[The duel of](3/1/3/3/3/_Rivalry-Nonrivalry) [Open-Closed is pivotal](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/_Open-Closed) [to our understanding](2/1/3/3/2/2/.Understanding) [of space -](1/2/1/3/3/3/3/.Space) [the dichotomy underlies](2/1/2/3/_Positive-Negative) key elements of [topological spaces and](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/1/.Topological%20Spaces) their subsets. In this paradox, boundaries [mark the divide](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/1/2/.Separation%20Marks) [between the open](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/_Open-Closed) and closed, inviting [contemplation of the](2/1/3/3/_Instinct-Reflection) [interplay between openness](1/2/1/3/3/_Open-Closed) [and closure in](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/_Open-Closed) limitless dimensions, encapsulated [by Johann Wolfgang](3/3/2/3/3/3/1/.Classical%20Solos) von Goethe's words, ["a man sees](2/1/3/1/1/.Seeing) in the world [what he carries](3/1/3/3/2/1/3/1/.Transport) in his heart."
