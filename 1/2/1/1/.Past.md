The past embodies the antecedent experiences and events that have come to pass, forming a sequential repository of all that was once the present. This concept holds in itself the memories, histories, and knowledge that provide a foundation for understanding the present and predicting the future. It is the context in which we are rooted, a fading reality that once was. However, as much as the past brings a sense of definition, it can no longer be interacted with or changed, becoming a fixed narrative, and hence, presenting itself as the antithesis to the mutable future.
