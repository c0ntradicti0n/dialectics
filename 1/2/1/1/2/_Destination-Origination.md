The triadic relationship of locale, region, and territory illuminates an essential contradiction in the understanding of geographic entities - the tension between destination and origination. Each locale, region, or territory maintains its local identity (origination) while simultaneously contributing to a broader concept of a unified whole (destination). The synthesis reconciles the tension, harmonizing the interaction between parts and a whole.
