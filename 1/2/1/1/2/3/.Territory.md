Territory refers to an area under the jurisdiction of a state, or entity with the authority to enforce rules and exercise power. It incorporates elements from both locales and regions but is distinct in its political implications of sovereignty and control. The notion of territory expresses concepts of inclusion and exclusion, promoting a clear boundary between the inside and the outside. It is a socio-political construct that shapes identities and interactions.
