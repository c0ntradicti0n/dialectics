A place, operating as the antithesis to undifferentiated space, represents a distinct localization within the spatial expanse. It suggests a portion of space that has been marked, bounded, or differentiated from its surroundings, signaling the existence of structured confines amidst the unbounded space. Yet, these finite places imply their oppositeâ€”they may always be transformed or mutated, thus giving rise to an ever-changing landscape which forms an integral part of the everywhere.
