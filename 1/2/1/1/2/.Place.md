A place, operating [as the antithesis](1/1/2/1/2/.Negation) to undifferentiated space, [represents a distinct](1/2/1/3/1/3/1/_Identical-Different) [localization within the](3/1/1/2/3/3/2/_Localization-Identification) spatial expanse. It suggests a portion of space that has been marked, bounded, or differentiated from its surroundings, [signaling the existence](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) [of structured confines](1/2/1/1/_Structured-Unstructured) [amidst the unbounded](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/3/.Unbounded) space. Yet, these [finite places imply](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Finite%20Sets) their oppositeâ€”they may always be transformed or mutated, thus giving rise to [an ever-changing landscape](3/3/2/1/2/3/.Landscape%20Architecture) which forms an [integral part of](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/2/1/.Integral%20Domains) the everywhere.
