A region is defined as a broad geographic area distinguished by similar features, usually physical and cultural. It is a conglomeration of individual locales, converging common characteristics into an overarching identity that is greater than the sum of its parts. Each locale within a region contributes contextually to the definition of the region and conversely, the essence of the region bestows meaning and relevance to its constituent locales.
