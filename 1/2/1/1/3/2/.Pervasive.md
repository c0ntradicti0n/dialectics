Pervasiveness describes a ubiquitous phenomenon in a context where it permeates or spreads throughout a particular space or system. It inherently encompasses the idea of omnipresence but focuses more on the characteristic of an entity spreading extensively across space. Yet, 'pervasive' implies a dynamic spread of influence or characteristic, opening the dialectic tension between what is stationary and what is ongoing.
