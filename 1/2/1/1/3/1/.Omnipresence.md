Conceptualizing space further, we arrive at [omnipresence - a](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/.Omnipresent) [state where something](1/2/1/2/3/1/2/3/.Location) [transcends the limits](1/1/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) of territory, region, and locale. This [denotes an entity](1/2/1/3/1/2/4/3/3/.Notation) [or phenomenonâ€™s presence](1/1/2/1/1/.Presence) everywhere at the same time. However, [this perceived ubiquity](1/2/1/1/3/3/.Ubiquitous) is subject to [our perception and](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) [ability to interpret](3/3/2/2/3/3/3/.Interpretive%20Freedom) it, indicating the [antithetical nature inherent](2/1/2/2/_Attractive-Repulsive) [in perception and](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) existence.
