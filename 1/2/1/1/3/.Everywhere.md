Everywhere signifies the complete pervading presence, an infinite projection of multitude places across the entirety of space. It is a synthesis that encompasses both the continuity of space and the particularity of places, expressing the endless interplay of structured and unstructured. The ubiquity of everywhere harbors a paradoxâ€”it is both, a singular entity that permeates the entire spatial expanse, as well as a multiplicity of places scattered across the expanse.
