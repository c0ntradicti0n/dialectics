Ubiquity is akin to omnipresence but emphasizes the widespread incidence or prevalence of an entity. It points to the natural propinquity of the entity across multiple spatial scales ranging from the locale, region, and territory. An entity's ubiquity contributes to the pervasive quality which bridges the gap between ubiquity and omnipresence.
