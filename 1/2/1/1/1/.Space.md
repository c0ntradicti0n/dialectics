Space, in the broadest sense, can be understood as an omnipresent continuum that provides the structure necessary for physical entities to exist. Its intrinsic emptiness equates to pure potentiality, a precondition for entities to take shape and act in relation to others. However, this uniform continuity of space paradoxically creates the possibility of non-continuity, spatial gaps that allow for the formation of distinct places.
