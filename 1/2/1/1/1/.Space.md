Space, in the broadest sense, can [be understood as](2/2/3/2/1/3/.Interpretation) [an omnipresent continuum](1/2/1/1/3/_All-encompassing) that provides the [structure necessary for](1/1/3/3/1/2/2/.Structure) [physical entities to](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/.Physical) exist. Its intrinsic [emptiness equates to](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/1/1/.Empty%20Set) pure potentiality, a [precondition for entities](2/3/1/1/2/1/.Criteria) [to take shape](1/2/1/3/1/3/1/1/3/.Repetition) and act in relation to others. However, this uniform [continuity of space](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/2/.Continuity) [paradoxically creates the](3/3/2/2/3/3/2/.Paradox) possibility of non-continuity, [spatial gaps that](1/2/1/1/1/.Space) allow for the [formation of distinct](1/2/1/3/1/3/1/_Identical-Different) places.
