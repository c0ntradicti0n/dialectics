[Position-relocation defines the](1/2/1/1/1/_Position-Relocation) [dialectic relationship resulting](2/1/2/3/_Positive-Negative) from the interplay [of space's elementary](1/2/1/1/1/.Space) components. Acting as [the antinomic mutual](2/2/2/1/_Organic-Inorganic) relation, it emphasizes [the paradoxical state](3/3/2/2/3/3/2/.Paradox) of being fixed in space, yet subject to continual movement, echoing the [perpetual flux within](1/1/3/2/1/1/_Static-Flux) static conditions.
