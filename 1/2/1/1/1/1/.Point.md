[A point in](1/2/1/2/3/1/2/1/.Point) [space represents a](1/2/1/3/3/3/3/.Space) [fundamental geometric condition](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) marked by singularity. As the primal symbol of position, [a point implies](2/2/2/3/1/1/_Implication-Contradiction) stability but also [insignificance due to](1/1/3/1/1/2/2/.Intangible) its zero-dimensional nature.

["Euclid alone has](3/3/3/2/2/3/.The%20Aeneid) [looked on beauty](2/2/2/.Beauty) bare", writes poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, signifying the [elegance of such](2/2/2/_Function-Form) elementary concepts.
