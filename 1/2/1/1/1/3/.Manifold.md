[A manifold embodies](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/.Manifolds) [the paradox of](3/3/2/2/3/3/2/.Paradox) [simultaneous simplicity and](1/1/3/1/1/3/_Simplicity-Complexity) complexity, consisting of [points and planes](1/2/1/3/1/2/3/_Plane-Space) to form a [structure of higher-dimensional](1/2/1/1/2/2/3/2/.Higher-Dimensional) complexity. It is [a conceptual unity](1/3/1/2/1/1/3/3/.Unification) of position and relocation, symbolizing the [transition from linear](1/2/1/1/2/1/3/_Linear-Nonlinear) movement into a [universe of multiple](1/2/3/3/2/1/1/.Observable%20Universe) pathways.

Albert Einstein's words, ["time and space](1/2/3/.Space-Time) are modes by which we think and not conditions in which we live", reverberate this dynamism of manifolds.
