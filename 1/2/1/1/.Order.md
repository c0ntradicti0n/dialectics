[Order is the](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/1/.Order) [arranged manner of](1/1/3/3/1/1/1/.Arrangement) [interconnectedness in the](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) complexity of existence, [reflecting a structured](2/1/1/3/3/2/3/.Reflecting) pattern. These patterns inform the set of laws on [which natural phenomena](2/1/.Natrual%20Necessity) depend. This sequential [arrangement is crucial](1/1/3/3/1/1/1/.Arrangement) for building models, one of which is geometry, to [comprehend the complex](1/2/1/1/1/3/3/3/.Complex%20Structure) and diverse nature of the physical universe.
