[The dialectical relationship](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) [of structured and](3/1/3/3/1/2/3/3/_Unstructured-Structured) [unstructured reflects the](3/1/3/3/1/2/3/3/_Unstructured-Structured) [synthesis of spatial](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Spatial) order and chaos, [of confinement and](1/3/1/2/1/1/1/3/.Confinement) freedom. Structured space adheres to systemic organization and regularity, establishing places, locales, regions, while the [unstructured signifies the](3/1/3/3/1/2/3/3/_Unstructured-Structured) vast, infinite and [freely mutable quality](1/1/3/2/1/1/3/1/.Unchangeability) of space. The [interplay between the](3/1/3/2/1/.Principles%20of%20Games) two constitutes the [creation of everywhereâ€”an](1/2/1/1/3/.Everywhere) [amalgamation of manifold](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/.Manifolds) [yet distinct places](1/2/1/1/2/.Place) scattered across the sweeping, unbounded spatial continuum.
