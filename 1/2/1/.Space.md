[Space is the](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) vast, seemingly infinite [expanse that accommodates](1/1/3/2/3/2/1/3/.Expanse) everything we know to exist. It [is characterized by](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/3/_Homogeneous-Heterogeneous) its three dimensions, [which enable matter](3/1/1/_Intention-Product) to have a position and direction relative to other objects. Though seemingly passive and neutral, space defines relationships, separations, and connections, [providing the context](3/1/1/2/3/2/1/2/_Meaning-Context) for all physical entities. By itself, [space is an](1/2/1/3/3/3/3/.Space) [abstract realm of](1/1/3/1/1/2/2/2/.Abstract) mere locations, devoid of content, and yet, its existence is presupposed for any matter to occupy or any event to occur. [Its seeming emptiness](1/2/1/2/1/2/.Empty%20Space) is a crucial backdrop against which [the universe plays](3/1/3/2/1/.Principles%20of%20Games) out.
