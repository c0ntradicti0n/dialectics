Space is the abstract and conceptual framework within which we position and locate things. It provides the context for understanding the relationship between objects and their relative positions. Space can be understood as a three-dimensional extension that encompasses length, width, and height. It serves as the backdrop against which objects and events occur and allows for the organization and understanding of our physical environment.
