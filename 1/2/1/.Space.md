Space is the vast, seemingly infinite expanse that accommodates everything we know to exist. It is characterized by its three dimensions, which enable matter to have a position and direction relative to other objects. Though seemingly passive and neutral, space defines relationships, separations, and connections, providing the context for all physical entities. By itself, space is an abstract realm of mere locations, devoid of content, and yet, its existence is presupposed for any matter to occupy or any event to occur. Its seeming emptiness is a crucial backdrop against which the universe plays out.
