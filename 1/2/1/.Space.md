[Space is the](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) vast, seemingly infinite [expanse that accommodates](1/1/3/2/3/2/1/3/.Expanse) [everything we know](1/3/1/1/2/1/2/_Known-Unknown) to exist. It [is characterized by](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/3/_Homogeneous-Heterogeneous) its three dimensions, [which enable matter](3/1/1/3/3/_Self-Sufficiency-Dependency) [to have a](2/2/2/2/3/2/3/.Desire) [position and direction](1/1/3/2/1/2/1/2/.Direction) [relative to other](1/3/1/1/3/3/_Relative-Absolute) objects. Though seemingly passive and neutral, space defines relationships, separations, and connections, [providing the context](3/1/1/2/3/2/1/2/_Meaning-Context) [for all physical](1/1/3/1/1/2/1/1/.Physical) entities. By itself, [space is an](1/2/1/3/3/3/3/.Space) [abstract realm of](1/1/3/1/1/2/2/2/.Abstract) mere locations, devoid of content, and yet, its existence [is presupposed for](2/1/3/3/1/3/3/.Presumption) [any matter to](3/3/1/3/2/2/2/.Self-Determination) [occupy or any](3/2/3/3/3/1/2/.Land%20Ownership) event to occur. [Its seeming emptiness](1/2/1/2/1/2/.Empty%20Space) [is a crucial](3/1/3/3/1/2/1/2/_Essential-Nonessential) [backdrop against which](3/3/2/1/1/3/.Layout%20&%20Composition) [the universe plays](3/3/3/1/1/2/.Big%20Bang%20Theory) out.
