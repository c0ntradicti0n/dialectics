Space provides a framework for the placement and interaction of objects, defined by three-dimensional extension, with no preferred direction. It's the canvas upon which objects exist, move, and interact. Each point in space is unique and distinct, setting a stage for differentiation, but this static nature of space fails to capture the dynamic change of reality, which is encapsulated in time, leading us to a dialectical synthesis.
