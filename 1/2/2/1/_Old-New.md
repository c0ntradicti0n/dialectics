The "Old-New" signifies the dialectical relation between the past and the present. While yesterday, age, and history represent the realm of the 'old', they are intrinsically tied to the 'new'. The synthesis of the old and the new reflects the continuity and flux of time, where each new moment is birthed from the old and in turn becomes the old giving rise to newer moments.
