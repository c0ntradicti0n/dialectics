While yesterday, age, [and history represent](2/3/2/3/3/1/.History) the realm of the 'old', they are intrinsically tied to the 'new'. [The synthesis of](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [the old and](3/3/2/3/3/1/_Old-New) [the new reflects](2/1/1/3/3/2/3/.Reflecting) [the continuity and](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/2/.Continuity) flux of time, [where each new](2/3/1/2/2/3/.New%20Models) moment is birthed [from the old](3/3/2/3/3/1/_Old-New) and in turn [becomes the old](1/2/2/1/_Old-New) giving rise to newer moments.
