A Millennium, spanning a thousand years, serves to apprehend large historical periods, providing a long-range [perspective on the](1/2/1/2/3/3/1/2/2/.Perspective) progression of civilization. This measurement of [time not only](2/1/3/2/2/1/3/.Time) [provides a chronological](1/2/1/3/1/1/1/.Chronology) order but also [reveals sociopolitical and](2/3/3/3/1/3/2/2/.Sociocultural%20Aspects) cultural trends. Marcus Garvey perfectly encapsulates this: "A people without the knowledge [of their past](2/3/2/3/3/1/.History) history, origin and [culture is like](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/2/2/2/.Culture) a tree without roots."
