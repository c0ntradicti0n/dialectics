A Millennium, spanning a thousand years, serves to apprehend large historical periods, providing a long-range perspective on the progression of civilization. This measurement of time not only provides a chronological order but also reveals sociopolitical and cultural trends. Marcus Garvey perfectly encapsulates this: "A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots."
