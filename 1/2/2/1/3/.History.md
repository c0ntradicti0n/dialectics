History is the recorded past, a narrative formed from multiple chronologies and threads of events woven together to form a collective memory of human experiences across ages. It chronicles the flow of time, documenting transformations, growth, decay, and renewal over extended periods. History forms the summative backdrop to our present, influencing our outlook towards the future.
