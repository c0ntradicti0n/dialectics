[The past embodies](1/2/2/1/.Past) [the antecedent experiences](3/3/2/2/3/3/.Themes%20and%20Interpretations) and events that have come to pass, forming a sequential repository of all that was once the present. [This concept holds](1/1/2/3/2/3/.Theorem) in itself the memories, histories, and knowledge that provide [a foundation for](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) [understanding the present](1/2/2/3/.Present) and predicting the future. It is [the context in](3/1/1/2/3/2/1/2/_Meaning-Context) which we are rooted, a fading [reality that once](2/1/3/2/2/2/1/.Fact) was. However, as much as the [past brings a](1/2/2/1/.Past) sense of definition, it can no longer be interacted with or changed, becoming a fixed narrative, and hence, presenting itself as the antithesis to the mutable future.
