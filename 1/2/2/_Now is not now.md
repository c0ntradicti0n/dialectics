The concept "Now is not now" underlines the inherent paradox within the understanding of 'now'. The 'now' at any instant is fleeting and transient, for it constantly becomes the past while paving the way for the future. Thus, the 'now' that we comprehend is already a past 'now', making the true 'now' eternally elusive. This points to the fundamental limitation in our ability to pin down the present, reflecting the continuous, inexorable flow of time. In this context, "Now is not now" reveals the dialectical contradiction and unity between the static past, the dynamic future, and the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present.
