[The concept "Now](1/2/2/3/1/.Today) [is not now"](1/2/2/_Now%20is%20not%20now) [underlines the inherent](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) [paradox within the](3/3/2/2/3/3/2/.Paradox) understanding of 'now'. [The 'now' at](1/2/2/_Now%20is%20not%20now) [any instant is](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/1/.Immediate) fleeting and transient, for it constantly [becomes the past](1/2/2/1/.Past) while paving the way for the future. Thus, the ['now' that we](1/2/2/_Now%20is%20not%20now) [comprehend is already](2/2/1/1/3/2/.Understanding) a past 'now', [making the true](3/2/2/1/1/2/1/3/2/_Truth-Process) 'now' eternally elusive. This points to [the fundamental limitation](3/3/1/3/3/2/3/.Limitations%20of%20Reason) in our ability to pin down the present, reflecting the continuous, inexorable flow of time. In this context, ["Now is not](1/2/2/_Now%20is%20not%20now) [now" reveals the](1/2/2/_Now%20is%20not%20now) [dialectical contradiction and](3/3/2/1/2/2/_Irony-Contradiction) [unity between the](1/1/3/1/1/1/_Unity-Disunity) static past, the dynamic future, and the ever-changing present. the ever-changing present.
