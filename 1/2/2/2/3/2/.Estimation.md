[Estimation characterizes a](1/2/2/2/3/2/.Estimation) [process of approximating](2/2/3/3/.Truth%20Approximation) [or determining the](1/1/3/1/3/3/1/.Trial%20and%20Error) [numerical value of](1/1/3/2/2/.Calculate) an unknown quantity. It underscores the interplay between observation, assumptions, and mathematical algorithms. Estimation echoes Aristotle's words: "Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom."
