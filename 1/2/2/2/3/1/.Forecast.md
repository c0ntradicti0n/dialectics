Forecast, an informed [prediction of a](2/2/3/1/2/3/.Prediction) [future event or](3/3/2/3/3/2/_Past-Future) trend, embodies the constant human endeavor [to anticipate the](2/1/3/3/3/.Forethought) course of events. It instigates a critical evalutaion regarding possibilities, probabilities, and uncertainties, reinforcing Niels Bohr's assertion: "Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future."
