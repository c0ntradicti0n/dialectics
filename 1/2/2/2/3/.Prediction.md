Prediction is the act of projecting the future based on understanding and analysis of past and present states. It involves the extrapolation of existing trends, patterns or dynamics into the future. As an attempt to anticipate tomorrow, prediction brings a sense of structure and meaning to the potential chaos of future possibilities.
