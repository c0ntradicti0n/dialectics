Projection, a refined form of estimation, [extrapolates existing data](1/2/2/2/3/3/.Projection) [into the future](3/3/2/3/3/2/_Past-Future) in a structured and formalized manner. This process outlines [the anticipatory and](3/3/3/3/_Before-During-After) [predictive nature of](2/3/1/3/1/2/.Predictive%20Utility) human cognition, fostering [understanding by charting](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) the path to the future. Albert [Einstein's quote resonates](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) here: "Imagination is [more important than](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/.Communication) knowledge."
