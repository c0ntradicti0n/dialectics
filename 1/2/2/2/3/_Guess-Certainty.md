[The contradiction of](3/3/2/1/2/2/_Irony-Contradiction) [Guess-Certainty embodies the](1/2/2/2/3/_Guess-Certainty) [eternal dialectical tension](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) [between the unreliability](2/3/1/3/3/2/.Unfalsifiable%20Concepts) of a guess, subject to change and error, and [the absolute confidence](1/1/3/3/3/2/2/.Certainty) of certainty. This dynamic illuminates the [perpetuals oscillation in](1/3/1/2/1/1/2/2/_Oscillation-Mass%20Difference) [human cognition when](2/1/3/2/.Cognition) [dealing with future](1/2/2/2/.Future) scenarios, summed up by Plato: "Opinion is the medium [between knowledge and](1/2/2/2/2/1/3/3/.Knowledge) ignorance."
