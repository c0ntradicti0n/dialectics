[The future represents](1/2/2/2/.Future) [all potentialities yet](2/2/1/2/1/_Potential-Realized) to come, a [realm of indeterminacy](1/1/3/2/_Countable-Uncountable) [that holds within](1/1/2/3/2/3/.Theorem) [it the unmanifested](3/1/3/1/1/3/3/1/1/2/.Plague) possibilities of existence. [It is shaped](3/1/1/2/3/3/2/1/2/.Square%20Shape) [by actions in](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/_Action-Reaction) [the present and](1/2/2/3/.Present) [carries within it](3/1/3/3/2/1/3/1/.Transport) our aspirations, fears, and anticipations. As [a counterpoint to](2/2/2/3/1/1/_Implication-Contradiction) the past, it [holds an inherently](2/2/3/1/2/1/.Assumption) dynamic quality, perpetually [in the process](3/1/1/2/2/2/1/1/1/2/2/1/.Process) of becoming. Yet, [while it stretches](1/2/1/3/3/2/1/.Stretch) infinitely ahead, the [future remains fundamentally](1/2/2/2/.Future) inaccessible, for it is always yet-to-come, [receding perpetually as](1/1/3/2/3/1/1/3/.Decline) the present unfolds.
