The future represents all potentialities yet to come, a realm of indeterminacy that holds within it the unmanifested possibilities of existence. It is shaped by actions in the present and carries within it our aspirations, fears, and anticipations. As a counterpoint to the past, it holds an inherently dynamic quality, perpetually in the process of becoming. Yet, while it stretches infinitely ahead, the future remains fundamentally inaccessible, for it is always yet-to-come, receding perpetually as the present unfolds.
