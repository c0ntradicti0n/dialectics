[The future represents](1/2/2/2/.Future) [all potentialities yet](2/2/1/2/1/_Potential-Realized) to come, a [realm of indeterminacy](1/1/2/3/1/2/.Rational) that holds within it the unmanifested possibilities of existence. [It is shaped](1/2/1/3/1/2/2/3/_Flat-Curved) by actions in [the present and](1/2/2/3/.Present) carries within it our aspirations, fears, and anticipations. As [a counterpoint to](2/2/2/3/1/1/_Implication-Contradiction) the past, it [holds an inherently](2/2/3/1/2/1/.Assumption) dynamic quality, perpetually in the process of becoming. Yet, while it stretches infinitely ahead, the [future remains fundamentally](1/2/2/2/.Future) inaccessible, for it is always yet-to-come, receding perpetually as the present unfolds.
