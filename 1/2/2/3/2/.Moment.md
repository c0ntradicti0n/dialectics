A moment, in its extended significance, [captures a distinct](1/2/1/3/1/3/1/_Identical-Different) [slice of the](3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/_Cutting-Hitting-Slicing) temporal continuum. Each moment, akin to today, is transient, but unlike today, [it manifests as](3/3/3/_Manifestation-Transformation) [a discreet entity](3/1/2/3/1/3/2/.Responsible%20disclosure) in the flow of time, preserving [the events in](1/2/2/3/3/1/.Event) [a point of](1/2/1/2/3/1/2/1/.Point) space-time. But the [continuity and infinitesimal](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/2/.Continuity) [division of time](1/2/1/3/1/1/1/3/.Time%20Measurement) introduces a new sense of time, which is Occurrence.
