A moment, in its extended significance, [captures a distinct](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/1/2/.Separation%20Marks) [slice of the](3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/_Cutting-Hitting-Slicing) temporal continuum. Each moment, akin to today, is transient, but unlike today, [it manifests as](3/1/1/2/2/_Manifestation-Interpretation) [a discreet entity](3/1/2/3/1/3/2/.Responsible%20disclosure) [in the flow](2/1/3/1/2/2/.Rhythm) of time, preserving [the events in](1/2/2/3/3/1/.Event) [a point of](1/2/1/2/1/3/3/1/.Point) space-time. But the [continuity and infinitesimal](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/1/2/3/.Continuous%20Functions) [division of time](1/2/3/2/1/2/.Time%20Dilation) [introduces a new](2/3/1/2/2/3/.New%20Models) sense of time, which is Occurrence.
