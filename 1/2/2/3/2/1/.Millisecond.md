Milliseconds are the minute fragments that make up the larger entity of time, the minimal granules that contribute to the buildup of events, sequences, and cycles. They serve as the foundation, the building blocks of larger time scales, demonstrating the potency of the conceivably inconsequential.

"Every second is of infinite value." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
