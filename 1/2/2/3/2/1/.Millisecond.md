[Milliseconds are the](1/2/1/3/1/1/2/1/1/.Milliseconds) [minute fragments that](1/2/2/3/2/1/.Millisecond) make up the larger entity of time, the minimal [granules that contribute](1/3/2/3/3/_Formation-Dissipation) to the buildup of events, sequences, and cycles. They serve as the foundation, the building blocks of larger time scales, demonstrating the potency of the conceivably inconsequential.

["Every second is](1/2/2/3/1/.Today) of infinite value." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
