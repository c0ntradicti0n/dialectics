[In the notion](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) of instant-eternity, the [transmundane conception of](1/1/2/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) time is actualized. [The ephemeral "instant"](1/2/2/3/_Instant-Eternity) [represents the fleeting](1/2/2/3/1/_Duration-Instant) present, the "today" that is in perpetual transition. On the other hand, [eternity stands for](1/2/2/3/_Instant-Eternity) the ever-lasting time, [within and encompassing](1/2/3/3/2/_Inside-Outside) [all conceivable "moments"](1/2/2/3/2/.Moment) and "occurrences". The reconciliation of these [antithetical entities creates](1/1/1/3/_Sameness-Different) [a synthesized dimension](3/2/2/3/1/.Dimensions) [of time where](2/1/3/2/2/1/3/.Time) [the instant is](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/1/.Immediate) [the concentrated eternity](1/2/2/3/_Instant-Eternity) and vice versa.
