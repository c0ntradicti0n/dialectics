In the notion of instant-eternity, the transmundane conception of time is actualized. The ephemeral "instant" represents the fleeting present, the "today" that is in perpetual transition. On the other hand, eternity stands for the ever-lasting time, within and encompassing all conceivable "moments" and "occurrences". The reconciliation of these antithetical entities creates a synthesized dimension of time where the instant is the concentrated eternity and vice versa.
