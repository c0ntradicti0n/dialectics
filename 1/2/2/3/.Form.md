Form refers to the visible shape or configuration of something, giving it a distinct identity. It encapsulates both order and geometry, unifying these principles to provide a perceivable, tangible manifestation. Form transcends mere spatial parameters, encapsulating aesthetic, functional, and symbolic dimensions. While it may be driven by rules and ratios, it is equally informed by intuitive, emotional, and cultural considerations, revealing a rich interplay between rigidity and fluidity, precision and impression, conformity and creativity.
