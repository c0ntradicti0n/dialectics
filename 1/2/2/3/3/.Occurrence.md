[Occurrence goes beyond](1/2/2/3/3/.Occurrence) [the singularity of](3/3/3/1/1/2/_Singularity-Expansion) [a moment and](1/2/2/3/2/.Moment) [encapsulates an event](2/1/3/2/2/1/1/.Event) that spans over multiple discreet moments. [An occurrence characterizes](1/2/2/3/3/.Occurrence) a set of [moments that collectively](1/2/2/3/2/.Moment) contribute to a particular event, alluding to a sense of duration. But [this concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) continuous change, marked [by discrete moments](1/2/2/3/2/.Moment) of a happening, reveal a broader temporality, manifesting as [the unity of](1/1/3/1/1/1/_Unity-Disunity) instant and eternity.
