An Event is a singular instance occurring within the frame of time. It symbolizes something of significance that has happened within the continuum, serving as discrete points of interest or importance around which cognizant beings orient themselves.

"Each event is preceded by Prophecy. But without the hero, there is no Event." - Frank Herbert
