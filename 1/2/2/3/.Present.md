[The present constitutes](1/2/2/3/.Present) the immediate now, [a fleeting intersection](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/1/2/.Union%20and%20Intersection) [between the past](3/3/2/3/3/2/_Past-Future) and the future. [It carries within](3/1/3/3/2/1/3/1/.Transport) [it the residue](1/3/1/2/3/3/1/1/2/.Aromaticity) [of the past](1/2/2/1/.Past) [as memory and](2/1/3/2/2/.Memory) [the potentiality of](1/2/2/2/1/3/1/.Potential) [the future as](1/2/2/2/.Future) anticipation. Here, the past is actualized, [and the future](1/2/2/2/.Future) is determined. The present, in its [perpetual vanishing and](1/1/1/_Vanishing-of-vanishing) becoming, embodies a dynamic transition, a [constant flux that](1/1/3/2/1/1/_Static-Flux) [integrates the static](1/1/3/2/2/3/2/1/.Integration) [past and the](2/3/2/3/3/_Past-Present) [dynamic future into](1/2/2/2/.Future) [a single unity](1/1/3/1/1/1/_Unity-Disunity) of existence, embodying [the dialectical synthesis](.System) [of these antithetical](2/1/2/2/_Attractive-Repulsive) concepts.
