Dusk, the synthesis [in our conceptualization](2/1/3/3/2/2/.Understanding) of "Today", is a gentle decline, [a gradual dimming](1/2/3/1/2/2/1/1/_Dim-Light) of the day's [vibrancy that nudges](1/2/1/1/3/1/1/.Presence) the world into [the whispering darkness](2/3/2/2/2/_Silence-Noise) of night. It [signifies an ending](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/3/.End%20of%20day) [and a culmination](3/2/2/1/1/1/1/3/.Concurrence) [of the continual](1/2/1/1/3/1/2/3/.Perpetuity) [interplay of light](1/3/1/1/1/2/.Waves%20and%20Optics) and dark, of activity and rest. [The dusk is](1/2/2/3/1/3/.Dusk) [both an end](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/3/.End%20of%20day) in itself and [also the emergence](1/2/2/2/1/3/1/3/.Emergent) of a new beginning, an enduring [cycle of renewal](3/3/3/3/2/1/_Cycle-Renewal) fixed within the continuity of time.

["What we call](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) [the beginning is](3/2/3/3/2/2/3/_Start-Finish) often the end. And to make [an end is](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/3/.End%20of%20day) to make a beginning. The end [is where we](2/1/3/2/2/1/2/.Place) start from." - T.S. Eliot
