Dusk, the synthesis in our conceptualization of "Today", is a gentle decline, a gradual dimming of the day's vibrancy that nudges the world into the whispering darkness of night. It signifies an ending and a culmination of the continual interplay of light and dark, of activity and rest. The dusk is both an end in itself and also the emergence of a new beginning, an enduring cycle of renewal fixed within the continuity of time.

"What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from." - T.S. Eliot
