The dialectical union of dawn, noon, and dusk under the concept of "Today" encapsulates the paradigm of "Duration-Instant". Duration, as the unceasing flow of moments, creates the stage where instances - like dawn, noon, and dusk, emerge. An instant, however, is a distinct snip caught from the continuous flow of Duration, a nugget of time marked by its specific quality. Yet within each instance, there lies the essence of the overall duration, making an instant a condensed reflection of the enduring progression of time.
