[The dialectical union](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) of dawn, noon, [and dusk under](1/2/3/1/2/2/2/_Dawn-Dusk) [the concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) ["Today" encapsulates the](1/2/2/3/1/.Today) paradigm of "Duration-Instant". Duration, as the [unceasing flow of](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/2/3/2/_Thick-Thin%20Flow) moments, creates the [stage where instances](3/1/1/2/3/3/2/3/.Instance%20Segmentation) - like dawn, noon, and dusk, emerge. An instant, however, is a distinct snip caught [from the continuous](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/2/.Continuity) flow of Duration, [a nugget of](2/1/3/3/2/1/.Clue) [time marked by](1/2/1/3/1/1/1/3/.Time%20Measurement) its specific quality. [Yet within each](3/3/2/2/3/2/2/.Multiple%20Perspectives) instance, there lies [the essence of](2/2/3/2/3/_Essence-Appearance) the overall duration, [making an instant](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/1/.Immediate) [a condensed reflection](2/2/2/1/3/3/2/1/.Reflection) [of the enduring](2/2/1/2/3/3/.Lasting) progression of time.
