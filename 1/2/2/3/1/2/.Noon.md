Noon, as the antithesis to dawn, represents the climax of the day when the sun is at its zenith. It is a symbol of culmination, a peak moment that carries with it a silent understanding that after the high-noon the light will gradually decline, leading us towards closure. Still, noon holds a moment of balance, a pause from the relentless motion of time as if for an instant time itself takes a respite, offering the intensity of a seized moment.

"The two most powerful warriors are patience and time." - Leo Tolstoy
