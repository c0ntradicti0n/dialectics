[Today is an](1/2/2/3/1/.Today) [immediate and subjective](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/1/.Immediate) concept of time, [indicating the present](1/2/2/3/.Present) [moment that is](1/2/2/3/2/.Moment) currently unfolding itself. However, the fleeting [nature of this](1/2/1/2/2/2/.Void) ["today" transforms it](1/2/2/3/1/.Today) rapidly into "yesterday", [undermining the permanence](2/2/3/2/3/3/.Change%20and%20Permanence) of the present. [This concept confronts](1/1/2/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) its own transience, [leading to the](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/1/1/.Thermosetting) [conception of time](1/2/2/.Time) as moments.
