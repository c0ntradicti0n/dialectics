The dawn is the thesis in the analysis of "Today". It signifies the onset of a new temporal cycle, piercing the obscurity of the past night with the first light of the day. The dawn ushers in the continuum of "Today", imbuing the world with a resurgence of vitality, possibilities, and the commencement of human activity. It marks an interval in the perpetual totality of time, offering a commencement and a dismissal of absolute elapsed stages. 

"Precisely the least, the softest, lightest, a lizard's rustling, a breath, a flash, a moment - a little makes the best happiness. Be still." - Friedrich Nietzsche
