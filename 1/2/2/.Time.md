Time, unlike the static nature of space, represents change and progression, flowing in an unbroken sequence from past to future. It marks the transition of states, allowing events to have a before and an after. Time cannot be seen, touched, or halted; yet, its effect is felt and observed in everything. Through its unidirectional flow, it creates the notion of causality, a chain of events following a certain order. While space defines where, time determines when; it is the invisible metric that records the history of the cosmos and all that it contains.
