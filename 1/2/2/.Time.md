Time, unlike the [static nature of](1/1/3/2/1/_Static-Dynamic) space, represents change and progression, flowing in an unbroken [sequence from past](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/.Sequence) to future. It [marks the transition](3/3/3/2/1/2/.Crossing%20the%20Threshold) of states, allowing events to have a before and an after. Time cannot be seen, touched, or halted; yet, its effect is felt and observed in everything. [Through its unidirectional](1/1/3/2/1/2/1/2/.Direction) flow, it creates [the notion of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) causality, a chain of events following a certain order. [While space defines](1/2/1/3/3/3/3/.Space) where, time determines when; it is [the invisible metric](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/1/1/.Metric) that records the history of the [cosmos and all](1/2/1/2/1/2/2/.Cosmic%20Vacuum) that it contains.
