Time, unlike the [static nature of](1/2/3/2/3/_Static-Moving) space, represents change and progression, flowing [in an unbroken](1/1/3/1/1/1/3/1/.Undivided) [sequence from past](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/.Sequence) to future. It [marks the transition](1/1/1/3/1/.Transition) of states, allowing [events to have](1/2/2/3/3/1/.Event) [a before and](3/1/3/3/1/2/3/2/_Before-During-After) an after. Time cannot be seen, touched, or halted; yet, its effect [is felt and](2/1/3/1/3/.Feeling) observed in everything. [Through its unidirectional](1/1/3/2/1/2/1/2/.Direction) flow, it creates [the notion of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) causality, a chain [of events following](1/2/2/3/3/1/.Event) a certain order. [While space defines](1/2/1/3/3/3/3/.Space) where, time determines when; it is [the invisible metric](2/3/1/2/3/.Measurement) [that records the](3/2/1/3/1/2/2/.Lecture%20Recording) [history of the](2/3/2/3/3/1/.History) [cosmos and all](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) that it contains.
