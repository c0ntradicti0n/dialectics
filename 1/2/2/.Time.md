Time is a fundamental dimension that governs the sequence and duration of events and processes. It is the framework that allows us to organize and measure the order and duration of phenomena. Time is experienced as a linear progression from past to present to future, and it plays a crucial role in our perception and understanding of cause and effect, change, and the passage of age or duration.
