Time is a flowing continuum, providing a measurement of existence and change, linking events through a unidirectional sequence of past, present, and future. It serves as the medium for the occurrence of events, the transitions from potential to actual. However, this constant flow of time, with its inherent linearity, stands in contrast to the concept of space, where no particular direction is favored, setting the stage for a dialectical conflict.
