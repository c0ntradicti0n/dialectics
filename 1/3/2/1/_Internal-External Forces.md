The trifecta of continental drift, seafloor spreading, and convergent [boundaries give rise](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) to the idea [of the Earth](1/3/2/.Earth) [being shaped by](1/3/1/2/3/3/2/1/1/2/1/3/.Bending) both internal and external forces. Internal [forces such as](1/3/1/2/1/1/3/1/.Forces) [plate tectonics build](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) landforms, while external [forces like weathering](1/3/2/3/.Weather%20Patterns) [and erosion sculpt](3/3/3/3/3/1/1/2/_Erosion-Settlement) them. This interplay paints a comprehensive [picture of Earth's](1/3/2/.Earth) geodynamics.
