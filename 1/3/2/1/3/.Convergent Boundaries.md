[Convergent boundaries exemplify](1/3/2/1/3/.Convergent%20Boundaries) places where two [tectonic plates meet](1/3/2/1/3/.Convergent%20Boundaries) and manifest the visible results of [seafloor spreading and](1/3/2/1/2/.Seafloor%20Spreading) continental drift. They give rise to [various geologic phenomena](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) such as mountain chains, island arcs, and deep-sea trenches. Together, they portray the ongoing movement and reshaping of the Earth's surface.
