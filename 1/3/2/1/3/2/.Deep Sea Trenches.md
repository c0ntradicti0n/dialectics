Deep Sea Trenches, [the deepest points](1/2/1/1/3/1/3/_Surface-Depth) [in the earthâ€™s](3/1/3/3/3/3/1/2/.Oceans) crust, depict the [spectacular transformative effects](3/3/3/_Manifestation-Transformation) of plate tectonics. Being the result of the most [radical plate divergence](1/3/2/1/3/_Collision-Divergence) and collision processes, [trenches manifest the](1/3/2/1/3/2/.Deep%20Sea%20Trenches) [zenith of lithospheric](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) metamorphosis. They provide a gauge to [the profound and](3/3/2/2/3/3/.Themes%20and%20Interpretations) [dark foundations of](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) [Hegel's notion of](.System) change; an embodied profundity, where change enacts its most extreme antithesis.

"In the end, or rather, as things really are, there's really so much chaos out there in the deep sea. But it's interesting to think of how we humans see this yet realize that compared to the universe, even [all these oceanic](3/1/3/3/3/3/1/2/.Oceans) [trenches are an](3/1/3/1/2/3/1/.Fortifications) infinitesimal nothingness." - Zheng Chouyu
