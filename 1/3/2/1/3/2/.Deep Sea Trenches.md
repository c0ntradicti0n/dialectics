Deep Sea Trenches, the deepest points in the earthâ€™s crust, depict the spectacular transformative effects of plate tectonics. Being the result of the most radical plate divergence and collision processes, trenches manifest the zenith of lithospheric metamorphosis. They provide a gauge to the profound and dark foundations of Hegel's notion of change; an embodied profundity, where change enacts its most extreme antithesis.

"In the end, or rather, as things really are, there's really so much chaos out there in the deep sea. But it's interesting to think of how we humans see this yet realize that compared to the universe, even all these oceanic trenches are an infinitesimal nothingness." - Zheng Chouyu
