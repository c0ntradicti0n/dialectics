Island Arcs, chains [of islands lined](1/3/2/1/3/3/.Island%20Arcs) [along the continental](1/3/1/1/1/1/3/2/2/_North-South) margins as a result of intense volcanic activity, showcase [the Hegelian synthesis](.System) in the physical world. They represent the creative outcome of the collision and divergence processes [of the earthâ€™s](1/3/2/.Earth) lithosphere. The transformation of mobile sea floor into stable [land masses exemplifies](1/3/2/1/3/1/.Mountain%20Ranges) [nature's innate capacity](1/3/1/3/3/2/2/.Natural%20Selection) for harmonious reconciliation of antithetical processes.

"Every island to a child is a treasure island." - P.D. James
