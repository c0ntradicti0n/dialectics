Mountain ranges, massive continental features formed over millions of years, are embodiment of the immense power and dynamism of earth's internal forces. Crumpling of the earth's lithosphere due to orogenic processes like continental collision and subduction lead to their development. They're symbolic of the earth's ceaseless evolution and change, making them a geographic representation of the Hegelian dialectic of continual becoming. 

"Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion." - Anatoli Boukreev
