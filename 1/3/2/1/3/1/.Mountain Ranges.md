Mountain ranges, massive [continental features formed](1/3/2/1/1/3/.Rift%20Valleys) over millions of years, are embodiment of the immense power and dynamism [of earth's internal](1/3/2/1/_Internal-External%20Forces) forces. Crumpling of [the earth's lithosphere](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) [due to orogenic](2/2/3/1/3/1/.Cause) [processes like continental](1/3/2/1/1/3/.Rift%20Valleys) [collision and subduction](1/3/2/1/3/_Collision-Divergence) lead to their development. They're symbolic [of the earth's](1/3/2/.Earth) ceaseless evolution and change, making them [a geographic representation](1/2/1/1/2/_Destination-Origination) [of the Hegelian](.System) [dialectic of continual](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) becoming.

["Mountains are not](1/3/2/1/3/1/.Mountain%20Ranges) stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion." - Anatoli Boukreev
