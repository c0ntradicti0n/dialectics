Plate tectonics is a theory in geology that explains the large-scale movements of the Earth's lithosphere, which is divided into several rigid plates. These plates interact with each other at their boundaries, causing various geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountain ranges. The concept of plate tectonics revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's dynamic nature and provided a unifying framework for explaining a wide range of geological phenomena.

Plate tectonics is the thesis of the dialectical unit. It highlights the stability and rigidity of the Earth's lithospheric plates and their characteristic movements. The Earth's surface is divided into several major plates, including the Eurasian Plate, African Plate, North American Plate, South American Plate, Pacific Plate, and Indo-Australian Plate, among others. These plates rest upon the semi-fluid asthenosphere below and move in different directions at varying speeds, driven by the underlying convective currents.
