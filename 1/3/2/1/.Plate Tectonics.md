[Plate tectonics is](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) [a theory in](2/2/3/2/_Hypothesis-Theory) [geology that explains](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) [the large-scale movements](3/3/2/3/3/1/2/.Traditional%20Movements) [of the Earth's](1/3/2/.Earth) lithosphere, which is divided into several rigid plates. These plates interact with each other at their boundaries, causing [various geological phenomena](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountain ranges. The [concept of plate](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) [tectonics revolutionized our](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) understanding of the [Earth's dynamic nature](1/3/2/1/3/_Collision-Divergence) and provided a unifying framework for explaining a wide [range of geological](1/3/2/1/3/1/.Mountain%20Ranges) phenomena.

[Plate tectonics is](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) the thesis of the dialectical unit. It highlights the [stability and rigidity](2/2/2/1/3/3/1/3/.Structural%20Stability) [of the Earth's](1/3/2/.Earth) [lithospheric plates and](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) their characteristic movements. [The Earth's surface](1/3/2/.Earth) is divided into several major plates, including the Eurasian Plate, African Plate, North American Plate, South American Plate, Pacific Plate, and Indo-Australian Plate, among others. These plates rest upon the [semi-fluid asthenosphere below](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/2/_Porous-Dense) and move in different directions at varying speeds, driven by the underlying convective currents.
