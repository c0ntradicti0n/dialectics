[Seafloor spreading provides](1/3/2/1/2/.Seafloor%20Spreading) [the mechanism behind](1/2/3/3/3/3/.Lift) continental drift. Embedded in the theory of plate tectonics, it postulates that new crust is [formed at mid-ocean](1/3/2/1/2/2/.Oceanic%20Crust) [ridges as plates](1/3/2/1/1/2/.Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge) diverge, and is [destroyed at subduction](1/3/2/1/2/3/.Subduction%20Zones) [zones as plates](1/3/2/1/2/3/.Subduction%20Zones) converge. This accounts for the dynamic nature of the [Earth's crust but](1/3/2/1/2/2/.Oceanic%20Crust) raises questions on the geological implications, leading to the [concept of convergent](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/2/1/2/.Convergent%20Sequences) boundaries.
