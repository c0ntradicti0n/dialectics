Seafloor spreading provides the mechanism behind continental drift. Embedded in the theory of plate tectonics, it postulates that new crust is formed at mid-ocean ridges as plates diverge, and is destroyed at subduction zones as plates converge. This accounts for the dynamic nature of the Earth's crust but raises questions on the geological implications, leading to the concept of convergent boundaries.
