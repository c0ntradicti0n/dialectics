The Oceanic Crust, presenting the antithesis, [is continually created](1/1/2/2/.Change) [at the mid-ocean](3/1/3/3/3/3/1/2/.Oceans) [ridges and consumed](3/3/3/3/3/1/1/2/_Erosion-Settlement) in subduction zones. [Its geological life](1/3/2/1/2/_Creation-Destruction) cycle, much younger compared to its continental counterpart, underscores [the planet's ceaseless](1/1/3/2/3/3/2/3/2/.Infinite%20Limits) crustal dynamics. This [perpetual reconstruction and](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/2/_Reconstruction-Deconstruction) [deconstruction contradict the](3/3/2/1/2/2/1/.Deconstructivism) stable record upheld by magnetic striping.
