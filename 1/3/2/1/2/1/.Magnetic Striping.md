Magnetic Striping, the thesis, is a testament to Earth's magnetic history etched on the ocean floor. These alternating magnetic bands on either side of the mid-ocean ridges provide cogent evidence of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. As new magma surges forth at the mid-ocean ridges, it captures the prevailing direction of Earth's magnetic field, preserving a record of geomagnetic reversals over millions of years.
