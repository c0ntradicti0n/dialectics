Magnetic Striping, the thesis, is a [testament to Earth's](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2/3/.Earthenware) [magnetic history etched](1/3/2/1/2/1/.Magnetic%20Striping) [on the ocean](3/1/3/3/3/3/1/2/.Oceans) floor. These alternating [magnetic bands on](1/3/3/1/1/3/_Magnetic-Radiation%20Belts) either side of [the mid-ocean ridges](1/3/2/1/1/2/.Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge) provide cogent evidence [of seafloor spreading](1/3/2/1/2/.Seafloor%20Spreading) and plate tectonics. [As new magma](3/1/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Minerals) surges forth at the mid-ocean ridges, it captures the prevailing direction of Earth's magnetic field, preserving a record [of geomagnetic reversals](1/3/2/1/2/1/.Magnetic%20Striping) over millions of years.
