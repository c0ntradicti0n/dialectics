Subduction Zones, emerging as the synthesis, picturize the convergence [of tectonic plates](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) where one slab [of oceanic crust](1/3/2/1/2/2/.Oceanic%20Crust) [is thrust beneath](1/2/3/3/3/1/.Thrust) another. These zones bear witness to [the culmination of](2/3/1/1/2/3/.Conclusion) [the creation process](3/2/2/2/3/2/_Creation-Publication) [at the mid-ocean](3/1/3/3/3/3/1/2/.Oceans) [ridges and the](1/3/2/1/1/2/.Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge) subsequent destruction in the subduction trenches. They balance the [scales between the](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/1/2/.Scale) [perpetuity of oceanic](1/3/2/1/2/2/.Oceanic%20Crust) crust and the [temporality of magnetic](1/3/1/1/1/1/3/2/2/1/.Magnetic%20Fields) striping, underlying the [earth's eternal cycle](1/2/2/3/3/3/.Cycle) [of creation and](3/3/3/1/.Creation%20Myths) annihilation.
