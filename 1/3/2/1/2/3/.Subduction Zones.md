Subduction Zones, emerging as the synthesis, picturize the convergence of tectonic plates where one slab of oceanic crust is thrust beneath another. These zones bear witness to the culmination of the creation process at the mid-ocean ridges and the subsequent destruction in the subduction trenches. They balance the scales between the perpetuity of oceanic crust and the temporality of magnetic striping, underlying the earth's eternal cycle of creation and annihilation.
