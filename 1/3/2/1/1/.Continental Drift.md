Continental drift, as [proposed by Alfred](2/3/1/1/1/_Discovery-Invention) Wegener, describes the [movement of the](2/1/1/2/1/1/.Movement) [Earth's continents over](1/3/2/1/1/.Continental%20Drift) geological time. It [suggests that continents](3/1/3/3/3/3/1/2/.Oceans) [were once united](1/1/3/1/1/1/_Unity-Disunity) [in a supercontinent](1/3/2/1/2/3/.Subduction%20Zones) known as Pangaea, [which later split](1/2/2/3/2/_Split-Continuity) [apart to form](1/1/3/3/1/2/3/.Formation) present-day landmasses. However, [it lacked a](1/2/1/2/1/1/.Filled%20Space) [satisfactory explanation of](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [the mechanism behind](2/3/1/3/2/1/.Mechanistic%20Causation) the movement, leading [to the idea](2/3/1/1/1/1/.Idea) of seafloor spreading.
