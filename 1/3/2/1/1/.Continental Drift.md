Continental drift, as [proposed by Alfred](2/3/1/1/1/_Discovery-Invention) Wegener, describes the [movement of the](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) [Earth's continents over](1/3/2/1/1/.Continental%20Drift) geological time. It [suggests that continents](3/1/3/3/3/3/1/2/.Oceans) were once united [in a supercontinent](1/3/2/1/2/3/.Subduction%20Zones) known as Pangaea, which later split apart to form present-day landmasses. However, it lacked a satisfactory explanation of the mechanism behind the movement, leading to the idea of seafloor spreading.
