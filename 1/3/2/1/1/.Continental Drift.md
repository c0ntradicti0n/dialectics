Continental drift, as proposed by Alfred Wegener, describes the movement of the Earth's continents over geological time. It suggests that continents were once united in a supercontinent known as Pangaea, which later split apart to form present-day landmasses. However, it lacked a satisfactory explanation of the mechanism behind the movement, leading to the idea of seafloor spreading.
