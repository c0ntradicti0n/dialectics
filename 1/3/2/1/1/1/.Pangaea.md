Pangaea, as the initial thesis, is an epitome of unity representing the interconnectivity of all continents. This supercontinent, existing around 250 million years ago, symbolizes a primitive geological era where seas and landscapes were vastly different from today. Pangaea's existence and eventual aeons-long fragmentation signify the tectonic shifts influencing climate, topography, and the dispersion of flora and fauna.
