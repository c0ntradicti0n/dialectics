Pangaea, as the initial thesis, is an epitome of [unity representing the](3/3/3/1/2/1/_Unity-Division) interconnectivity of all continents. This supercontinent, existing around 250 million years ago, [symbolizes a primitive](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/3/1/.Primitive%20Functions) [geological era where](1/2/2/1/3/1/.Era) [seas and landscapes](3/3/3/1/2/_Land-Sea-Sky) were vastly different from today. Pangaea's [existence and eventual](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) [aeons-long fragmentation signify](1/1/3/1/2/2/2/.Fragmentation) [the tectonic shifts](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) influencing climate, topography, and the dispersion of flora and fauna.
