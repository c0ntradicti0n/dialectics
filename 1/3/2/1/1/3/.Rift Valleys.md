Rift Valleys, the synthesis, encapsulates the process of breakaway from the original continent, reflected in the extensive cracks slicing earth's crust. These linear-shaped depressions mark the regions where continental masses have torn apart due to persistent stretching and thinning of crust over geologic time. Rift valleys embody an amalgamation of creation represented by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and separation suggested by Pangaea, attesting to the earth's dynamic topographical transformations.
