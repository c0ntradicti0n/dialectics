Rift Valleys, the synthesis, encapsulates the [process of breakaway](1/3/2/1/1/3/.Rift%20Valleys) from the original continent, reflected in [the extensive cracks](3/1/2/2/1/_Circuit-Breach) slicing earth's crust. [These linear-shaped depressions](1/2/1/2/3/2/1/_Linear-Circular) [mark the regions](1/1/3/2/3/2/1/2/.Region) [where continental masses](1/3/2/1/1/.Continental%20Drift) have torn apart due to persistent stretching and thinning of crust over geologic time. Rift [valleys embody an](1/3/2/1/1/3/.Rift%20Valleys) [amalgamation of creation](3/3/3/1/.Creation%20Myths) represented by the [Mid-Atlantic Ridge and](1/3/2/1/1/2/.Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge) [separation suggested by](1/1/3/2/3/1/_Separation-Union) Pangaea, attesting to [the earth's dynamic](1/3/2/1/3/_Collision-Divergence) topographical transformations.
