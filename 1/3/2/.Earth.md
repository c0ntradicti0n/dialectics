Earth – the planet we inhabit – is composed of myriad distinct, yet interconnected components that breathe life into it. These interconnected entities – the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere – are the elements that enable life as we perceive it. The Earth is a massive closed system in which geological, biological, climatological, and anthropogenic factors influence every other variable.
