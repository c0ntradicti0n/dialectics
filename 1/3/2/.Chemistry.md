Chemistry operates on a scale between Physics and Biology, bridging the gap between fundamental particles and life itself. It is the study of substances and their transformations, focusing on molecular bonds, reactions, and the properties that emerge from these relations. These chemical properties and transformations form the basis of life and material existence. However, understanding substances in isolation fails to grasp life's intricate dynamics, leading to a call for Biology, which investigates the nature and mechanisms of living organisms.
