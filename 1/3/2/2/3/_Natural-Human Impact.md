Natural-human impact refers to the interaction between natural factors (such as weather patterns) and human activities (like overfishing or pollution) on Earth's ecological systems. This intertwining of human and natural influences can lead to both positive and negative outcomes, often multidimensional and complex. While human activities can lead to degradation of ecosystems, they can also include conservation efforts to restore and protect these systems. Yet, the historical trend leans more towards harmful impacts. As the anthropologist Jane Goodall said, "What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make."
