[Natural-human impact refers](1/3/2/2/3/_Natural-Human%20Impact) to the interaction [between natural factors](1/3/1/3/2/3/.Natural%20Selection) (such as weather [patterns) and human](1/1/2/3/3/.Pattern) activities (like overfishing [or pollution) on](1/2/2/2/1/1/3/3/.Environmental) Earth's ecological systems. This intertwining of [human and natural](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/_Man-made-Natural%20Based) [influences can lead](1/2/1/1/2/3/2/3/.Influence) to both positive and negative outcomes, often multidimensional and complex. While human activities can lead to degradation of ecosystems, they can also include conservation efforts to restore and protect these systems. Yet, the historical trend leans [more towards harmful](1/3/1/3/3/1/_Beneficial-Detrimental) impacts. As the [anthropologist Jane Goodall](3/1/3/3/3/1/2/3/3/.Biodiversity) said, "What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make." to make."
