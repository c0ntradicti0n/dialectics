Ocean acidification, an adverse climatic consequence, is a decrease in the pH level of the Earth's oceans, making [them more acidic](1/3/1/2/3/1/1/.Acids) due to the incorrect dissolution of [excessive atmospheric carbon](1/3/2/2/3/2/.Ocean%20Acidification) dioxide. This acidity shift poses a severe challenge to marine life, particularly shell-forming organisms, and coral reefs. Increased acidity inhibits the ability of these organisms to properly form their shells and skeletal structures, [thereby threatening biodiversity](3/1/3/3/3/1/2/3/3/.Biodiversity) and disrupting marine food webs. As [marine scientist Scott](1/2/1/1/2/3/3/3/.Discovery) Doney said, "Ocean [acidification is one](1/3/2/2/3/2/.Ocean%20Acidification) of the big [environmental threats to](1/3/2/2/3/_Natural-Human%20Impact) marine ecosystems, yet itâ€™s one that the American public is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of." is really not that aware of."
