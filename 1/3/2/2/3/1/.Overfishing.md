Overfishing, an unsustainable depletion of fish populations through intense fishing activities, destabilizes the marine ecosystem and threatens both biodiversity and livelihoods. The high demand for seafood, combined with advanced fishing technologies, leads to extraction rates surpassing the reproductive capabilities of fish species. Overfishing alters food chains, leading to unintended consequences like an explosion of predator species and depletion of prey. As the German environmentalist Ernst Friedrich Schumacher quoted, "Man 'fishes' the species on which he preys down to a level at which it no longer pays to continue."
