Overfishing, an unsustainable [depletion of fish](1/3/2/2/3/1/.Overfishing) [populations through intense](2/2/1/3/2/_Abundance-Scarcity) fishing activities, destabilizes [the marine ecosystem](1/3/2/2/_Flora-Fauna%20Interaction) and threatens both biodiversity and livelihoods. The high demand for seafood, combined [with advanced fishing](3/1/2/2/3/1/2/.Whaling) technologies, leads to extraction rates surpassing the reproductive capabilities of fish species. [Overfishing alters food](1/3/2/2/3/1/.Overfishing) chains, leading to unintended consequences like an explosion of [predator species and](1/3/1/3/1/3/1/.Predation) depletion of prey. As the German [environmentalist Ernst Friedrich](2/3/3/2/1/2/.Environmental%20Economics) Schumacher quoted, "Man ['fishes' the species](1/3/2/2/3/1/.Overfishing) on which he preys down to a level at which it no longer pays to continue."
