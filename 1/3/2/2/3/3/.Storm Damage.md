Storm damage can result from different extreme weather events, like hurricanes or ice storms, often leading to widespread destruction of habitats, structures, and human life. Climate change seems to possibly intensify these extreme weather events, leading to more severe storm damage. Storms can lead to deforestation, erosion, flooding, and the immediate demolition of habitats, subsequently affecting both population and ecosystems. As the late English author John Fowles once said, "We know so little about nature and our place in it as if we were just landed on earth an hour ago."
