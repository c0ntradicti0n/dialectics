Reef Degradation, the [decline in the](1/1/3/2/3/1/1/3/.Decline) [health and vitality](2/1/1/3/1/.Health) of coral reefs, [can be attributed](2/2/3/1/3/.Causal%20Inference) to multiple causes, primarily overfishing, ocean acidification, and pollution. [These factors disrupt](3/1/2/1/3/_Integration-Disruption) [the delicate balance](2/2/2/1/3/3/1/2/.Aesthetics%20of%20Balance) of biodiversity, leading [to a cascading](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/2/.Succession) [effect on the](1/1/3/3/3/3/3/.Effect) entire ecosystem. The [mutualistic relationship between](1/3/2/2/2/_Symbiotic-Parasitic%20Relationship) [polyps and Zooxanthellae](1/3/2/2/2/.Zooxanthellae) [is affected leading](1/1/3/3/3/3/3/.Effect) to coral bleaching.
