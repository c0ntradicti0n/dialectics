Reef degradation, often resulting from coral bleaching, is a pressing environmental issue. This deterioration is often linked to rising sea temperatures and represents an intricate relationship between the polyps and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. When thermal stressors lead to expulsion of zooxanthellae from the host polyps, the reef loses its primary source of nutrients and vibrant colors, leading to a weakened state that is susceptible to disease and death.
