Polyps and Zooxanthellae, in a symbiotic relationship, depict an intricate balance, aiding each other for survival. Yet, the same relationship underscores the vulnerability, as any disturbance to this interaction can lead to a fundamental shift in the wider ecosystem, seen in [instances of reef](1/2/1/3/3/1/3/.Reef) degradation.
