[Polyp tentacles function](1/3/2/2/1/2/.Tentacles) as their primary [mechanism for foraging](2/1/1/2/1/3/1/.Foraging) and defense. Capable of dramatic extension and swift retraction, [tentacles embody the](1/3/2/2/1/2/.Tentacles) [Hegelian idea of](.System) [dynamism existing between](1/2/2/2/_Change-Stagnation) states of rest and unrest. They are tools of survival for the polyps, enabling interaction with the environment, and hence, are [emblematic of natureâ€™s](1/1/3/1/1/2/3/3/.Emblematic) [inventive mechanisms for](3/1/1/3/1/2/3/.Magnetic%20Manipulators) existence.
