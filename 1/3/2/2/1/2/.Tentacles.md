Polyp tentacles function as their primary mechanism for foraging and defense. Capable of dramatic extension and swift retraction, tentacles embody the Hegelian idea of dynamism existing between states of rest and unrest. They are tools of survival for the polyps, enabling interaction with the environment, and hence, are emblematic of natureâ€™s inventive mechanisms for existence.

"All great and beautiful work has come of first gazing without shrinking into the darkness." - John Ruskin
