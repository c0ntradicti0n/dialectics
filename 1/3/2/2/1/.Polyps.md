[Polyps are constructing](2/1/1/2/2/2/3/2/2/.Implantation) [organisms of coral](1/3/2/2/.Coral%20Reefs) reefs, characterized by [a cylindrical body](1/3/1/1/1/4/2/2/_Plane-Circular) [structure and an](1/1/3/3/1/2/2/.Structure) [opening encircled with](3/2/3/1/2/1/2/_Open-Closed) tentacles. They house microscopic algae, the Zooxanthellae, which provide [them with nutrients](2/1/1/3/1/3/2/.Micronutrients) through photosynthesis, while [themselves using the](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/1/1/.Thermosetting) [waste generated by](3/1/1/1/1/2/3/_Waste-Repurposed) [polyps in a](1/3/2/2/1/.Polyps) mutualistic relationship. Both [partners influence their](3/2/3/3/3/2/1/.Business%20Influence) [environment through their](3/3/2/1/2/3/_Nature-Environment) activities.
