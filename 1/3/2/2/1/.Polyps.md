[Polyps are constructing](1/3/2/2/1/3/.Budding) [organisms of coral](1/3/2/2/.Coral%20Reefs) reefs, characterized by [a cylindrical body](1/2/1/3/1/2/3/2/3/.Cylindrical%20Coordinate%20System) structure and an opening encircled with tentacles. They house microscopic algae, the Zooxanthellae, which provide [them with nutrients](2/1/1/3/1/3/2/.Micronutrients) through photosynthesis, while themselves using the waste generated by [polyps in a](1/3/2/2/1/.Polyps) mutualistic relationship. Both partners influence their [environment through their](1/3/1/3/2/.Ecology) activities.
