Polyps, the biological units of corals, are multicellular organisms which, through the symbiosis with microscopic algae, reproduce to create expansive coral colonies. These polyps serve a dual function: they directly contribute to the physical structure of the reef, while also harboring zooxanthellae within their tissues, an arrangement mutually beneficial for survival in the water scarce in nutrients. However, environmental stressors can lead to the expulsion of zooxanthellae from the polyps, causing whitening and loss of vitality in the coral colonies, a phenomenon known as coral bleaching.
