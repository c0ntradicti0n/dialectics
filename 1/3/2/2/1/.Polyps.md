Polyps are constructing organisms of coral reefs, characterized by a cylindrical body structure and an opening encircled with tentacles. They house microscopic algae, the Zooxanthellae, which provide them with nutrients through photosynthesis, while themselves using the waste generated by polyps in a mutualistic relationship. Both partners influence their environment through their activities.
