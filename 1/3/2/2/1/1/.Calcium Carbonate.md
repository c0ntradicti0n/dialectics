[Polyps extract calcium](1/3/2/2/1/1/.Calcium%20Carbonate) [ions and bicarbonate](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/2/3/.Ionization%20Isomers) [ions from seawater](1/3/2/2/3/2/.Ocean%20Acidification) to construct their [exoskeletons of calcium](1/3/2/2/1/1/.Calcium%20Carbonate) carbonate, or limestone. [This mineral is](3/1/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Minerals) malleable when initially formed, but hardens to provide the necessary infrastructure for the reef. Representing the tangible outcome of polyps' existence, Calcium Carbonate, hard yet brittle, serves as their hands-on response to the paradoxical needs of survival â€“ to endure yet to adapt.

["Geology is the](3/1/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Minerals) [study of pressure](1/3/1/2/3/1/3/1/2/.Pressure) and time. That's all it takes really. Pressure and time." - 'Shawshank Redemption'
