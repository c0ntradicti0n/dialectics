Polyps extract calcium ions and bicarbonate ions from seawater to construct their exoskeletons of calcium carbonate, or limestone. This mineral is malleable when initially formed, but hardens to provide the necessary infrastructure for the reef. Representing the tangible outcome of polyps' existence, Calcium Carbonate, hard yet brittle, serves as their hands-on response to the paradoxical needs of survival â€“ to endure yet to adapt.
