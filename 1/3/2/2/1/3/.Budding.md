Budding in polyps conceptually represents expansion of individual into community, a concise portrayal of the Hegelian conception of the individual's relationship to the universal. Individual polyps multiply asexually through budding, and these multitudes of cloned polyps aggregate to form the colony that is the coral reef, representing growth through unity and preservation through replication.

"A coral, you can destroy, but it comes back enormous." - Adolf Hitler (speaking about resilient opposition)
