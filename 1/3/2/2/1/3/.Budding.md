[Budding in polyps](1/3/2/2/1/3/.Budding) [conceptually represents expansion](1/1/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) of individual into community, a concise portrayal of the [Hegelian conception of](.System) the individual's relationship to the universal. [Individual polyps multiply](1/3/2/2/1/3/.Budding) asexually through budding, and these multitudes [of cloned polyps](1/3/2/2/1/3/.Budding) aggregate to form the colony that [is the coral](1/2/1/3/3/1/3/.Reef) reef, representing growth through unity and preservation through replication.

"A coral, you can destroy, but it comes back enormous." - Adolf Hitler (speaking about resilient opposition)
