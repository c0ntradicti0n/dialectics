Zooxanthellae is a group of yellow-green algae that form a symbiotic relationship with the coral polyps, residing within their tissues. This symbiosis is vital for the survival and health of coral reefs. The zooxanthellae provide the polyps with nutrients crucial for their growth and in return, they receive protection and access to sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. Yet, their survival partnership is vulnerable to changes in ocean temperatures, leading to disastrous consequences for the reef ecosystems.
