Zooxanthellae are microscopic, [photosynthetic algae that](1/3/2/2/2/.Zooxanthellae) [inhabit the tissues](2/2/2/1/3/2/.Homeostasis) of polyps, partaking [in a symbiotic](1/3/1/3/1/3/2/.Symbiosis) relationship. These unicellular [organisms provide nutrients](1/3/2/2/2/1/.Photosynthesis) to polyps through photosynthesis, and in turn use the waste products from [polyps for their](1/3/2/2/1/2/.Tentacles) survival. The relationship drives the bioconstruction [and bioerosion of](2/3/2/3/1/3/.Biology) coral reefs.
