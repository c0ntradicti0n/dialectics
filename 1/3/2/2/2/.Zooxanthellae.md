Zooxanthellae are microscopic, photosynthetic algae that inhabit the tissues of polyps, partaking in a symbiotic relationship. These unicellular organisms provide nutrients to polyps through photosynthesis, and in turn use the waste products from polyps for their survival. The relationship drives the bioconstruction and bioerosion of coral reefs.
