[Coral bleaching embodies](1/3/2/2/2/3/.Bleaching) [the transition from](1/1/1/3/1/.Transition) [symbiosis to parasitism](1/3/1/3/1/3/2/.Symbiosis) under environmental stress. [When the temperature](1/3/1/2/3/1/3/1/1/.Temperature) warms, the zooxanthellae begin to produce [toxic levels of](3/1/3/1/1/3/3/1/3/.Toxins) oxygen, causing the polyps to eject them leading to a loss of vibrant colors; hence, the term 'bleaching'. This devastating process illustrates the precarious balance in even the most enduring symbiotic relationships.

"Man should not consider his material possession his own, but as common to all, so as to share them without hesitation when others are in need." - [Thomas Aquinas](3/2/2/1/1/1/1/1/.Actus%20Reus)
