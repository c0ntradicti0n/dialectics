For Zooxanthellae, photosynthesis ushers in the transition from a parasitical to a symbiotic lifestyle within their polyp hosts. They convert light energy to organic compounds which provide nourishment, not only for themselves but also their polyp hosts, embodying the concept of mutual benefit as a probable outcome in any supposedly exploitative relationship.

"The sun shines and warms and lights us and we have no curiosity to know why this is so; but we ask the reason of all evil, of pain, and hunger, and mosquitoes and silly people." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
