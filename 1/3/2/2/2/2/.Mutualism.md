[The mutualistic relationship](1/3/1/3/1/3/2/.Symbiosis) [between the polyps](1/2/1/2/1/1/.Filled%20Space) [and the zooxanthellae](1/3/2/2/2/2/.Mutualism) provides a classic [exemplification of Hegelian](.System) [synthesis where individual](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [survival co-operates with](2/1/1/2/2/2/_Reproduction-Continuation) mutual sustenance. The [exchange of nutrients](2/1/1/3/1/3/.Nutrition) [between these two](3/3/2/3/1/1/2/.Second%20Position) disparate entities underscores [a deep sense](2/1/2/.Feelings) of collaborative existence, [emphasizing the dialectical](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) [fusion of self-sustenance](3/1/1/3/3/_Self-Sufficiency-Dependency) and co-dependance.

["Life is short](3/1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Short%20Swords) and we have never too much [time for gladdening](2/1/3/3/1/2/1/.Elation) [the hearts of](2/2/1/1/3/1/.Compassion) those who are traveling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind." - Henri Frederic Amiel
