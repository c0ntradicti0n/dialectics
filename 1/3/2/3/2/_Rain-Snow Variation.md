The fluctuation between rain and snow forms a crucial climatic variable that determines the hydrological footprint in temperate regions. The temperature-driven transition between these two states of precipitation affects both living organisms and the earth's physical geography, notably influencing water availability, ecosystem structure, and seasonal dynamics. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said it elegantly, "For after all, the best thing one can do when it is raining is let it rain."
