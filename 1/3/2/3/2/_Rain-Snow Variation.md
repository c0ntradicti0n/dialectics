[The fluctuation between](1/2/1/2/1/2/1/_Fluctuation-Stability) [rain and snow](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/1/.Rain) forms a crucial [climatic variable that](1/3/2/3/2/_Rain-Snow%20Variation) [determines the hydrological](2/1/1/1/2/1/.Hydrology) [footprint in temperate](1/3/2/3/2/_Rain-Snow%20Variation) regions. The temperature-driven transition between these two states of [precipitation affects both](1/3/2/3/2/_Rain-Snow%20Variation) [living organisms and](1/3/1/3/1/2/.Organismic%20Biology) [the earth's physical](1/3/2/.Earth) geography, notably influencing water availability, ecosystem structure, and seasonal dynamics. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said it elegantly, "For after all, the best thing one can do when [it is raining](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/1/.Rain) is let it rain."
