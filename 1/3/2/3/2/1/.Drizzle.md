Drizzle refers to a type of precipitation characterized by very fine droplets of rain, smaller than those of typical rain showers. The formation of drizzle occurs in low, stratus type clouds and is usually associated with mist or fog. This precipitation form is often less disrupting but can persistently occupy extended periods, creating damp conditions. Borrowing a quote from novelist Lang Leav, "The world around me is rebuilding itself, nurturing itself back to tonic bliss, a state of equilibrium."
