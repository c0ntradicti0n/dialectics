Monsoons are extended, [seasonal wind systems](3/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Wind%20Turbines) characterized by a [pronounced rainy season](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/1/.Rain) and a dry period. This weather pattern occurs in [tropical and subtropical](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/.Weather) regions and heavily influences regional climates. [Monsoons play essential](1/3/2/3/2/3/.Monsoons) roles in various sectors, such as agriculture, as they [bring much-needed rain](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/1/.Rain) [to water crops](2/1/1/2/1/3/3/.Farming) but can also cause severe flooding. In the words of Booker T. Washington, "Before the reward, there must be labor. You plant before you harvest."
