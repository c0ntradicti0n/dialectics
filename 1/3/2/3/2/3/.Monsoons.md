Monsoons are extended, seasonal wind systems characterized by a pronounced rainy season and a dry period. This weather pattern occurs in tropical and subtropical regions and heavily influences regional climates. Monsoons play essential roles in various sectors, such as agriculture, as they bring much-needed rain to water crops but can also cause severe flooding. In the words of Booker T. Washington, "Before the reward, there must be labor. You plant before you harvest."
