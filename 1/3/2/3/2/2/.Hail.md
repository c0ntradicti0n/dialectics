Hail is a form of precipitation characterized by solid ice spheres or irregular lumps, also known as hailstones. Hailstones form in thunderstorm clouds owing to violent updrafts and can be damaging to crops, structures, and vehicles when they reach ground level. The presence of hail often signals a strong storm system. As Thomas Paine said, "The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph."
