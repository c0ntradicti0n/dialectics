[Hail is a](1/3/2/3/2/2/.Hail) [form of precipitation](1/3/2/3/2/.Precipitation) [characterized by solid](1/3/2/_Solid-Liquid-Gas) [ice spheres or](1/3/3/3/2/3/_Ice-Liquid) irregular lumps, also known as hailstones. [Hailstones form in](1/3/2/3/2/2/.Hail) [thunderstorm clouds owing](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/3/.Cloudiness) [to violent updrafts](1/2/3/3/3/3/3/.Updraft) and can be damaging to crops, structures, and vehicles when they reach ground level. The [presence of hail](1/3/2/3/2/2/.Hail) often signals a strong storm system. As Thomas Paine said, "The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph."
