Precipitation, the antithesis [to the stability](1/1/3/2/1/1/1/2/.Stability) of fronts, plays [a crucial role](3/1/3/3/2/2/1/3/.Necessity) [in the hydrological](2/1/1/1/2/1/.Hydrology) cycle, the continuous [transfer of water](1/3/3/3/3/2/.Water%20Extraction) on, above, and [below the earth's](3/3/3/1/2/3/_Above-Below) surface. Precipitation occurs [when atmospheric water](1/3/2/3/2/.Precipitation) [vapor condenses and](3/3/3/1/2/2/_Vapor-Liquid) falls under gravity. [Such processes typically](3/1/1/2/2/2/1/1/1/2/2/1/.Process) [occur in cooler](3/1/1/1/1/1/3/3/3/.Cooling%20Fan) air masses, where [saturation vapor pressure](3/3/3/1/2/2/_Vapor-Liquid) is lower. Precipitation varies in form, from drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, to hail, each depending on atmospheric conditions, [notably temperature and](1/3/2/3/.Weather%20Patterns) [the state of](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/2/.State) the front.
