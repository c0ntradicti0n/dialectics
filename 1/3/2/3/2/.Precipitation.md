Precipitation is a fundamental meteorological phenomenon involving the fall of  water droplets or ice particles from clouds as rain, sleet, snow, or hail. It occurs when saturated air cools and condenses, and serves as the primary method for the distribution of freshwater around the planet. Its volume and intensity is often amplified by the activity of meteorological fronts and cyclone systems.
