Precipitation, the antithesis to the stability of fronts, plays a crucial role in the hydrological cycle, the continuous transfer of water on, above, and below the earth's surface. Precipitation occurs when atmospheric water vapor condenses and falls under gravity. Such processes typically occur in cooler air masses, where saturation vapor pressure is lower. Precipitation varies in form, from drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, to hail, each depending on atmospheric conditions, notably temperature and the state of the front.
