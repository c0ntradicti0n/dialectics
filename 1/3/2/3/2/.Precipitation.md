Precipitation is the product of the atmospheric condensation of water vapor, resulting in the falling of water droplets or ice particles to the earth's surface. It plays a vital role in the global water cycle, redistributing water from the atmosphere back to the surface and replenishing our water bodies. Precipitation occurs when moist air cools beyond the dew point, leading to nucleation and growth of water droplets or ice particles, which eventually fall due to gravity when they attain sufficient size. Precipitation can occur in different forms such as rain, sleet, snow, or hail, influenced by temperature profiles and atmospheric dynamics.
