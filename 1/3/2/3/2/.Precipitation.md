Precipitation, the antithesis to the stability of fronts, plays a crucial role [in the hydrological](2/1/1/1/2/1/.Hydrology) cycle, the continuous [transfer of water](1/3/3/3/3/2/.Water%20Extraction) on, above, and [below the earth's](3/3/3/1/2/3/_Above-Below) surface. Precipitation occurs [when atmospheric water](1/3/2/3/2/.Precipitation) [vapor condenses and](3/3/3/1/2/2/_Vapor-Liquid) falls under gravity. Such processes typically [occur in cooler](3/1/1/1/1/1/3/3/3/.Cooling%20Fan) air masses, where [saturation vapor pressure](3/3/3/1/2/2/_Vapor-Liquid) is lower. Precipitation varies in form, from drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, to hail, each depending on atmospheric conditions, [notably temperature and](1/3/2/3/2/_Rain-Snow%20Variation) the state of the front.
