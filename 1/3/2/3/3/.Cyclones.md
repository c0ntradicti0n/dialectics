Cyclones, the synthesis of fronts and precipitation, represent an intense vortex or a spiral wind system with low-pressure at the center, producing extreme weather conditions. Triggered by a combination of temperature, moisture contrasts along weather fronts and atmospheric instability, cyclones encompass tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons, or tornadoes, depending on their geophysical location. Their destructive potential is a product of their size, intensity, velocity, and path, and they encapsulate the full dialectic of meteorological phenomena, from static fronts to dynamic precipitation.
