Cyclones, the synthesis [of fronts and](1/3/2/3/1/.Fronts) precipitation, represent an [intense vortex or](1/2/3/3/3/2/2/.Viscous%20Drag) [a spiral wind](1/3/2/3/3/3/.Coriolis%20Effect) [system with low-pressure](1/3/2/3/_High%20Pressure-Low%20Pressure) at the center, [producing extreme weather](1/3/2/3/3/.Cyclones) conditions. Triggered by a combination of temperature, moisture contrasts [along weather fronts](1/3/2/3/1/.Fronts) and atmospheric instability, [cyclones encompass tropical](1/3/2/3/3/.Cyclones) storms, hurricanes, typhoons, or tornadoes, depending [on their geophysical](1/3/2/1/3/_Collision-Divergence) location. Their destructive potential is a product of their size, intensity, velocity, and path, and they encapsulate the full dialectic of meteorological phenomena, from [static fronts to](1/1/3/2/1/1/_Static-Flux) dynamic precipitation.
