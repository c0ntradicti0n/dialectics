Cyclones, also known as hurricanes or typhoons in different regions, are large-scale atmospheric circulatory systems characterized by low-pressure centers and spiraling winds. These powerful storms are fueled by heat transfer from warm ocean waters, leading to torrential rains and destructive winds. Cyclones form where conditions of warm sea surface temperatures, ample atmospheric moisture, and conducive wind patterns coexist, either in tropical or extratropical regions. The structure of cyclones, with their distinct eye, eyewall, and spiral bands, along with their track and intensity, are closely studied for weather prediction and hazard assessment.
