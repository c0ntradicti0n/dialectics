Cyclones are large-scale low pressure systems associated with severe storm events, featuring a cylindrical vortex of wind rotating around a low pressure core. They derive their energy from latent heat, which is released when moist air rises and condenses. The formation of cyclones is often associated with warm sea surface temperatures and atmospheric fronts, where air mass differences are greatest.

High Pressure-Low Pressure
Fronts, precipitation, and cyclones, are crucial elements of the global weather system, demonstrating the interplay of atmospheric high and low pressure systems. The juxtaposition of these pressure systems orchestrates our weather patterns, with low pressure broadly associated with stormy weather and fronts, and high pressure with calm, fair weather. This underscores the importance of understanding the dynamics between high and low pressure, as it can provide critical insights into weather prediction and climate modelling.
