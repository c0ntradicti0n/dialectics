The Coriolis Effect, a consequence of Earth's rotation, veers moving objects to the side, giving rise to the spiral form of storms. This spinning force, invisible yet persistent, confers hurricanes their clockwise or anticlockwise rotations, depending on their position relative to the Equator. While neither a calm 'eye' nor a disruptive shear, the Coriolis effect synthesizes the dynamics of storms. By providing them with a rotational characteristic, the Coriolis effect introduces an element that drastically separates storms from mere gusts of wind. It hence showcases the intricacies of motion on a rotating sphereâ€”the Earth. "Nature always wears the colors of the spirit" - Ralph Waldo Emerson
