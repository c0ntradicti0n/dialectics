A warm front represents the transition zone where a warm air mass overtakes a previously present cooler air mass. The progression of a warm front results in widespread, gradually increasing temperatures. Warm fronts often associate with stratiform clouds and extended topics of precipitation. The character of weather changes, for instance, from clear to cloudy or from heavy rain to light rain or drizzle. Iconic American author Mark Twain once humorously noted, "Climate is what we expect, weather is what we get."
