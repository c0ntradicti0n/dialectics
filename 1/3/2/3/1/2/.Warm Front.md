[A warm front](1/3/2/3/1/2/.Warm%20Front) [represents the transition](1/3/1/2/3/2/3/1/1/.d-d%20Transitions) zone where a [warm air mass](1/3/2/3/1/2/.Warm%20Front) overtakes a previously [present cooler air](3/1/1/1/1/1/3/3/3/.Cooling%20Fan) mass. The progression [of a warm](3/3/2/1/1/2/1/.Warm%20Colors) [front results in](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/2/_Forward-Backward) widespread, gradually increasing temperatures. Warm fronts often associate with [stratiform clouds and](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/3/.Cloudiness) extended topics of precipitation. The character of weather changes, for instance, from [clear to cloudy](3/1/1/1/1/2/3/1/2/1/.Clear) or from heavy [rain to light](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/1/.Rain) rain or drizzle. Iconic American author Mark Twain once humorously noted, "Climate is what we expect, weather is what we get."
