A cold front, in meteorological terms, [is a transition](1/1/1/3/1/.Transition) zone where a [colder air mass](1/3/2/3/1/1/.Cold%20Front) replaces a warmer air mass. This replacement often leads to changes in the weather, like rain and storms, [as cold fronts](1/3/2/3/1/1/.Cold%20Front) frequently associate with convective clouds. Cold [fronts can quickly](1/3/2/3/1/.Fronts) decrease the temperature, modify wind directions, and affect humidity. As French philosopher Gaston Bachelard said, â€œAir is the very substance of our freedom, the substance of superhuman joy."
