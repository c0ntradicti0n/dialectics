A cold front, in meteorological terms, is a transition zone where a colder air mass replaces a warmer air mass. This replacement often leads to changes in the weather, like rain and storms, as cold fronts frequently associate with convective clouds. Cold fronts can quickly decrease the temperature, modify wind directions, and affect humidity. As French philosopher Gaston Bachelard said, â€œAir is the very substance of our freedom, the substance of superhuman joy."
