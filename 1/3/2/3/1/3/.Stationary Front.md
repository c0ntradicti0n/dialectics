A stationary front, unlike moving cold or warm fronts, is a weather disruption where a boundary between two different air masses stays in one place. While not contributing to a significant change in temperature or the development of severe weather, stationary fronts can create persistent weather conditions, such as rain, snow or fog, for multiple days. As American author Hal Borland expressed, "No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn."
