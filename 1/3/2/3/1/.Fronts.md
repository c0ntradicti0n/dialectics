Fronts, in meteorology, [signify the boundary](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) [separating distinct air](3/1/3/3/1/1/1/3/.Air) masses, the interplay of which drives weather patterns. Differing in temperature, moisture content and density, [these air masses](3/1/3/3/1/1/1/3/.Air) operate under a thesis of thermodynamic equilibrium. When one [air mass displaces](1/2/3/3/3/2/1/.Air%20Resistance) another, a front forms. As an example, when a [cooler air mass](1/3/2/3/1/1/.Cold%20Front) advances upon a warmer one, causing the latter to rise, a cold front forms. Conversely, if the cooler air retreats, allowing [the warmer mass](1/3/1/1/1/3/2/.Thermodynamics) to advance, a warm front forms.
