Fronts are boundaries between different air masses with contrasting temperature and humidity. They play a crucial role in shaping the earth's weather patterns, often serving as a prelude to precipitation and storm events. Fronts can significantly influence the frequency and intensity of storms, including cyclones, by providing the conditions necessary for their formation.
