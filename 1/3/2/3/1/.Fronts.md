Fronts represent the interface between diverse air masses with different characteristics of temperature, humidity, and pressure. They are a critical component of our climate system, facilitating the transfer of heat and moisture across different regions. The interaction at these fronts leads to diverse atmospheric phenomena, such as changes in wind direction, temperature variations, and precipitation. The nature of the transition between air masses, whether abrupt or gradual, classify fronts into types like cold, warm, stationary, and occluded.
