Fronts, in meteorology, signify the boundary separating distinct air masses, the interplay of which drives weather patterns. Differing in temperature, moisture content and density, these air masses operate under a thesis of thermodynamic equilibrium. When one air mass displaces another, a front forms. As an example, when a cooler air mass advances upon a warmer one, causing the latter to rise, a cold front forms. Conversely, if the cooler air retreats, allowing the warmer mass to advance, a warm front forms.
