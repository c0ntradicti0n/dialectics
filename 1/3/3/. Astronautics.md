Astronautics is the science and technology of space travel and exploration. It uncovers the fundamentals of launching, operating, and utilizing craft that maneuver outside Earth's atmosphere. It is the antithesis to Earth in the sense that it represents the unknown beyond our planet; the vast, seemingly unending expanse that demands human exploration and understanding. It expands the realm of human experience and ambition well beyond the confines of our Earthly dwelling.
