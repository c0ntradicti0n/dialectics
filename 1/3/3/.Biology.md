Biology is the study of living organisms and the processes that govern life. It encompasses a vast array of disciplines, including genetics, physiology, ecology, and evolution. Biology aims to unravel the complexities of life, from the mechanisms of cellular processes to the interactions between organisms and their environment. It explores the diversity of species, their adaptations, and the interconnectedness of ecosystems.
