Biology, as the synthesis, integrates the laws of physics and the complexity of chemistry to explain the phenomenon of life. It deals with the study of living organisms, divided into many specialized fields that cover their morphology, physiology, anatomy, behavior, origin, and distribution. While physics provides the basic building blocks and chemistry elucidates the interactions between these blocks, biology provides the context in which these elements come to life, showing how complex, purposeful, and adaptive structures can arise from the simple and universal laws that govern the physical universe.
