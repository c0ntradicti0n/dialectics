Life support systems in space missions ensure the safety and well-being of astronauts by maintaining a habitable environment amidst the harsh extremes of space. These systems provide breathable air, manage waste, regulate temperature and humidity, and purify and recycle water, among other functions. Life support systems must be carefully designed and rigorously tested to minimize failure risk, given the criticality of these functions to crew survival and mission success.
