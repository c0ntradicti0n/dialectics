The synthesis of Thermal Control and Power Systems culminates in Life Support Systems. These subsystems provide survivable conditions for astronauts, regulating breathable atmosphere, waste management, food, and water supply, psychological healthcare, living quarters and safety measures. This synthesis embodies the concept of a self-contained environment, maintaining life in the harshness of space.
