Chemistry, in contrast to physics, focuses not on the fundamental principles of the universe, but rather on the interactions and transformations of matter. It represents the antithesis by focusing on the dynamic and complex relationships between elements and compounds, which are often unpredictable and contingent. Chemistry studies the intricate dance of molecules and atoms, their compositions, structures, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. Chemistry reveals the complexity of the material universe, a complexity that is often concealed by the grand, sweeping laws of physics.
