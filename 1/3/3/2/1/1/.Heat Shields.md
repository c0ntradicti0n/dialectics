Heat shields play a vital role in protecting spacecraft during atmospheric entry, reducing and dissipating the tremendous heat caused by atmospheric friction. They serve to ablate, or gradually wear away, transforming the kinetic energy of reentry into thermal energy that gets carried away by the shield's vaporization.
_"In the heat of reentry, it is the shield that bears the brunt for us all."_ - Apollo missions
