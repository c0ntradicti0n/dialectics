Effective Thermal Control systems are crucial due to the extreme thermal environment in space. As our thesis, temperature regulation maintains functional spacecraft operation, ensuring equipment and astronauts can withstand temperature fluctuations resulting from variances in solar radiation, albedo, and planetary emission. Active systems (like coolers) and passive ones (like insulation) work together to manage this complex thermal balance.
