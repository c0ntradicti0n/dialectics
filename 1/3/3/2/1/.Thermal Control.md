Thermal control is a crucial system in spacecraft design, managing the temperatures within and across different components to ensure functional integrity and mission success. Spacecraft operate under extreme thermal environments, ranging from the intense sunlight to the absolute cold of space, mandating robust thermal control solutions. These solutions incorporate both passive methods, such as insulation, surface coatings and heat shields, and active methods, which include heaters, coolers, and heat pipes.
