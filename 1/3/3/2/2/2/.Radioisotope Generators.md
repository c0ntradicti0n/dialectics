Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) offer a compact and reliable source of electrical power for spacecraft. By converting the heat released during the decay of a radioactive isotope into electricity, these units provide consistent power for many years. They are often employed on long-duration missions, or those venturing to the outer reaches of the solar system where solar energy is scarce.
