Photovoltaic cells are a cornerstone of spacecraft power systems, transforming solar energy into electricity. They are an attractive option due to their long lifespan, reliability, and the abundance of solar energy available in space, especially on missions staying within the inner Solar System. Their efficiency in converting sunlight into energy, however, remains a major focus of development.
