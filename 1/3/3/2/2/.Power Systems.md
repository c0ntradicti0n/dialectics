Spacecraft power systems generate and distribute electrical power to various subsystems and payloads, affecting the health and capability of the entire mission. The design and implementation of these systems hinge on factors like mission duration, distance from the Sun, power requirements, and available technology. Photovoltaic solar panels, radioisotope thermoelectric generators, fuel cells, and onboard batteries are common components of spacecraft power systems, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.
