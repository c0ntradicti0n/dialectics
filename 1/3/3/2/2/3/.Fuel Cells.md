Fuel cells, which generate electricity through a chemical reaction, often between hydrogen and oxygen, have been used in space missions since the early days of astronautics. Their advantage lies in their reliability, efficiency, and capability to provide large amounts of power on-demand, which makes them suitable for tasks requiring a high energy output in a relatively short time.

Solar-Nuclear
Spacecraft power systems often boil down to a choice between solar and nuclear energy. While photovoltaic cells offer a lightweight, inexhaustible source of power for spacecraft operating within the inner Solar System, the constant and long-lived energy production from radioactive materials makes nuclear power a necessary alternative for missions braving the darker, farther extents of our cosmic neighborhood.
