Evolution captures the transformative journey of life over geological timescales, predicated on the principle of descent with modification. It reveals how, through processes like mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and most prominently, natural selection, organisms change over generations, leading to speciation, adaptation, and sometimes extinction. Evolution is integrally connected to genetics, as genetic variations serve as the raw material upon which evolutionary processes act. At the same time, ecological factors often drive the direction and pace of evolution, as organisms adapt in response to their environmental contexts. Thus, evolution acts as a bridge, synthesizing genetic mechanisms and ecological dynamics into a coherent narrative of life's history and future potentialities.
