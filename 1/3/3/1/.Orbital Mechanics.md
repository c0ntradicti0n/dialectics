Orbital mechanics, often referred to as celestial mechanics, studies the motion of bodies in space, primarily influenced by the gravitational pull of other bodies. Its principles govern the paths of planets, moons, artificial satellites, and even spacecraft. At its core, orbital mechanics emerges from the juxtaposition of Newton's laws of motion)) and his law of universal gravitation. However, as systems grow more complex, so does the unpredictability of their interactions. Just as a body in orbit embodies a delicate balance between gravitational force and its inertia, the study of orbital mechanics is caught between the deterministic Newtonian laws and the uncertainty of real-world spatial interactions.
