Orbital mechanics, often [referred to as](1/1/3/1/3/2/2/.Self-Reference) celestial mechanics, studies [the motion of](1/1/3/2/1/2/.Motion) bodies in space, [primarily influenced by](3/2/3/3/3/2/1/.Business%20Influence) [the gravitational pull](1/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Gravitational%20Pull) of other bodies. [Its principles govern](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) [the paths of](3/3/2/2/2/1/3/.Rebirth%20and%20Renewal) planets, moons, artificial satellites, and even spacecraft. At its core, orbital mechanics [emerges from the](1/2/2/2/1/3/1/3/.Emergent) [juxtaposition of Newton's](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Newtonian%20Mechanics) [laws of motion))](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Newtonian%20Mechanics) [and his law](3/2/2/.Law) of universal gravitation. However, as systems grow more complex, [so does the](3/1/3/3/2/2/1/1/.Trends) [unpredictability of their](2/2/3/1/3/_Determinism-Randomness) interactions. Just as [a body in](3/1/1/2/3/2/1/2/1/1/.Person%20Identification) [orbit embodies a](3/3/3/3/3/2/1/_Orbit-Composition) [delicate balance between](2/2/2/1/3/3/1/2/.Aesthetics%20of%20Balance) [gravitational force and](1/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Gravitational%20Pull) its inertia, the [study of orbital](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/3/2/.Molecular%20Orbital%20Theory) [mechanics is caught](3/1/3/2/1/1/.Mechanics) [between the deterministic](2/2/3/1/3/_Determinism-Randomness) [Newtonian laws and](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Newtonian%20Mechanics) [the uncertainty of](1/1/3/3/3/2/3/.Uncertainty) real-world spatial interactions.
