The Jupiter slingshot is a type of gravity assist maneuver often used to accelerate spacecraft towards the outer planets. Jupiter, having the strongest gravitational field of any planet in the Solar System, is capable of providing a larger boost than other planets. This allows for faster travel times and extended missions, a vital prerequisite for deep space exploration.
_"Jupiter's gravitational pull is the slingshot arrow, flinging us further into the unknown."_ - Voyager 2
