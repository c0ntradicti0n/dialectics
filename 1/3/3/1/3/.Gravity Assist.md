Orbital transfer refers to the process of changing the orbit of a spacecraft from one trajectory to another. This maneuver is essential for various space missions, such as transferring a spacecraft to a different orbital altitude, changing the inclination of the orbit, or transferring to a different celestial body. Orbital transfers utilize the principles of orbital mechanics, including the conservation of energy and momentum, to achieve the desired trajectory. Different techniques and propulsion systems, such as chemical rockets or ion thrusters, are employed to perform orbital transfers.
