Gravity Assist or gravitational slingshot presents a synthesis of Escape Velocity and Hohmann Transfer. It employs the gravity of a planet or other celestial body to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft. This way, momentum is transferred from the celestial object to the spacecraft, proving a significant boost without relying on the spacecraft's propulsion. As such, gravity assists offer a way to conserve resources and expedite travel in our solar system and beyond.
