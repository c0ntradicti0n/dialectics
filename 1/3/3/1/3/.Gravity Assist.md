Gravity Assists, or slingshot maneuvers, are techniques employed in space travel to accelerate or decelerate spacecrafts using the gravity of a planet or a celestial body. By adjusting its trajectory to pass close to a planet, the spacecraft can receive a boost in velocity without any additional fuel, transforming the gravitational field into a powerful accelerator. However, the benefit of fuel savings are mitigated by the increased complexity in planning and a dependence on celestial alignment.
