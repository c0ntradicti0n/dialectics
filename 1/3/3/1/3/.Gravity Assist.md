Gravity assist describes the technique of using the gravitational pull of a planet or other celestial body to alter the speed and trajectory of a spacecraft. This maneuver leverages the orbital motion of the planet to impart a velocity boost to the spacecraft, effectively borrowing momentum without fuel expenditure. Gravity assist offers a means to achieve higher velocities and reach distant targets more feasibly, opening up a wider range of possibilities in interplanetary missions.
