Venus flybys, also known as gravity assists, use the planet's gravitational field to alter the path and speed of spacecraft. This technique drastically reduces the fuel requirement for planetary missions, enabling exploration of the farther reaches of the solar system. Venus, due to its proximity and significant gravitation, is particularly suitable for this purpose.
