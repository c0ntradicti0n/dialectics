Earth escape is the encounter of man's ambition defying Earth's gravitational pull—propelling a spacecraft to a velocity great enough that it can break free from Earth’s gravitational field. This firm pull of the Earth pervades our existence, the fundamental force that regulates cosmic order—essentially, the thesis of our reality. However, our quest to venture beyond earthly confines illuminates the antithesis—Earth escape. The potentiality of escape swings wide open the doors to unchartered territories and unexplored frontiers—ushering the dawn of a new destiny. "Man has always wanted to go to the moon, and now we have that capability" - James Irwin
