Escape velocity, in the realm of space travel, is the minimum speed required for an object to escape the gravitational pull of a planet or any celestial body without any further propulsion. It is a concept that epitomizes the tension between gravity, the force conservatively keeping objects in orbit, and the need for exploration beyond our celestial boundaries.
