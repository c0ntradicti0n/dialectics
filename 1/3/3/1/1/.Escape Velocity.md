Escape velocity pertains to the minimum velocity an object needs to escape the gravitational influence of a celestial body, without further propulsion. It is a useful metric to conceptualize space travel, determining the energy requirements for reaching space or other celestial bodies. Escape velocity is dependent on the mass and radius of the celestial body and is subject to the laws of gravity and conservation of energy. Understanding escape velocity is the starting point for mission design, helping determine fuel loads, engine power, and trajectory.
