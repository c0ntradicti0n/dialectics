Orbital mechanics is the branch of astrodynamics that studies the motion of objects in space under the influence of gravitational forces. It is based on the laws of motion and gravitation formulated by Isaac Newton. These laws, when applied to celestial bodies, enable the calculation and prediction of their orbits around other objects. By understanding orbital mechanics, scientists and engineers can determine the trajectory, velocity, and position of spacecraft in space. Theoretical foundations play a crucial role in formulating mathematical models that describe the orbital motion of objects.
