Escape Velocity describes the least velocity an object must have to escape from the gravitational field of a celestial body, without propulsion. It represents a thesis, the overcoming of a cosmic barrier. The larger the mass and density of the body, the greater its escape velocity, hinting at a profound principle: space travel is, fundamentally, about asserting physical dominion over gravity.
