Bound and Free mirror the inherently contradictory dynamics of velocity and gravity. The Earth binds, Mars entices, and Jupiter intimidatesâ€”each with distinct gravitational pulls, influencing the nature of the escape from their respective systems. Earth, with its comfortable familiarity, bounds you, while Mars and Jupiter, with their enigmatic worlds, seemingly draw you in, promising grandeur, mystery, and hints at the origin of life. Herein, Mystery teases Desire, and the gravitational pull provokes the daring velocity of the spacecraft, yearning to be free.
