Hohmann Transfer, as an antithesis to Escape Velocity, offers a fuel-efficient way to maneuver between two orbits around a celestial body. This elliptical transfer path, pioneered by Walter Hohmann, minimizes the energy required for the transition. Hohmann transfers represent the balance of energy and resources in space travel: achieving the goal using the minimum energy possible.
