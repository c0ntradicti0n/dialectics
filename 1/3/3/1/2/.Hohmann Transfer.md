The Hohmann Transfer is the most energy efficient method to travel between two different orbits around a single central body like a planet or star. This elliptical transfer orbit reduces the amount of energy required in doing so, giving us a sustainable way to navigate the cosmos. However, with limited launch opportunities and long transit times, it raises a fundamental question about how we balance our need for efficiency against our exploration timelines.
