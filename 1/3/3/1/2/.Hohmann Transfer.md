Johannes Kepler made significant contributions to the field of orbital mechanics with his laws of planetary motion. Kepler's first law, or the law of ellipses, states that the orbit of a planet or satellite around the Sun or a celestial body is an ellipse with the Sun or the body located at one of its foci. Kepler's second law, or the law of equal areas, states that a line segment joining a planet or satellite to the Sun or the body sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals. Kepler's third law, or the law of harmonies, establishes a relationship between the orbital period and the average distance of a planet or satellite from the Sun or the body.
