The Hohmann Transfer represents an energy-efficient path for changing orbits, involving two impulse burns: one to leave the initial orbit and another to enter the final orbit. This transfer maneuvering plays a critical role in space exploration and satellite deployment, offering an optimized solution to navigate between celestial bodies under gravitational influence. However, the efficiency of Hohmann Transfers comes with the caveat of longer travel times and infrequent launch windows, requiring careful mission planning and execution.
