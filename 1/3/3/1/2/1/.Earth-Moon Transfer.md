The Earth-Moon transfer presents a particular interplay between delicate finesse and resilient might. It is the passage of departing from one's home to traverse the gaping expanse of space, intending to land on Earth's natural satellite, the moon. This exercise is an elegant dance that must be performed with utmost precision. To accomplish a successful lunar injection, an ideal balance between the push away from Earth's pull and drawing towards the Moon's gravity must be achieved. "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." - Neil Armstrong
