Interstellar transfer presents a narrative of an epic voyage—transcending the confines of our solar system to probe the stars and galaxies beyond. It is an intimate mind-battle with measures of distance that have hitherto been unthinkable. To traverse lightyears, we must devise techniques and technologies currently untouched. The synthesis is the vibrant imagination—it dares us to push beyond our own limitations. "We are all explorers, driven to know what's over the horizon, what's beyond our own shores." - James Cameron
