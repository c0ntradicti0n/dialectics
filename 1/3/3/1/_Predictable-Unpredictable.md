[While all these](2/2/2/1/1/2/.Iteration) [approaches rely on](1/1/3/3/1/3/3/.Approach) [calculations forecasted well](1/2/2/2/3/1/.Forecast) in advance, their [execution is not](3/2/1/1/3/2/.Execution) without uncertainties. Variations [in celestial body](1/3/3/3/.Extraterrestrial%20Bodies) masses, spacecraft engineering [tolerances or local](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/1/2/1/.Local%20Boundedness) gravitational anomalies: all [affect the predicted](2/2/3/1/2/3/.Prediction) course and velocity, [making this gravitational](1/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Gravitational%20Pull) [ballet as much](3/3/2/3/1/.Classical%20Ballet) [art as it](2/3/3/1/3/.Art%20Forms) is science.
