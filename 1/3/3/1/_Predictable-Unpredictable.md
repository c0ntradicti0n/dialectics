The strategies of Escape Velocity, Hohmann Transfer, and Gravity Assist meet at the antinomic junction of what is Predictable and Unpredictable. While all these approaches rely on calculations forecasted well in advance, their execution is not without uncertainties. Variations in celestial body masses, spacecraft engineering tolerances or local gravitational anomalies: all affect the predicted course and velocity, making this gravitational ballet as much art as it is science.
