An argument is the antithesis of a proposition, building upon it by presenting a connected series of statements or reasons intended to establish a proposition's truth or falsity. It unfolds a higher level of complexity by incorporating premises (sub-propositions) and a conclusion, which is a deduced consequence of the premises. The argument provides a structured analysis of the proposition, probing its validity and seeking to persuade through logical reasoning, thus it inherently contains both affirmation and potential refutation of the initial proposition.
