Van der Waals forces, gentle attractions between atoms or molecules, contrive dipole-dipole attraction instances, London dispersion forces, or a continuum between both. They derive from an uneven electron distribution around an atom or molecule, inducing temporary partial charges that can instigate a transient dipolar behavior in adjacent particles. Van der Waals forces are instrumental in determining the physical and biological properties of atoms and molecules. Physicist Stephen Hawking once remarked, "We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe. If one were religious, one could say that God really does play dice."
