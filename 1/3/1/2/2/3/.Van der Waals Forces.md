[Van der Waals](3/3/1/2/2/2/2/.Vanir) forces, gentle attractions [between atoms or](1/3/1/2/1/.Atoms) molecules, contrive dipole-dipole attraction instances, London dispersion forces, or a continuum between both. They derive from an uneven [electron distribution around](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/2/.Electron%20Delocalization) [an atom or](1/3/1/2/1/.Atoms) molecule, inducing temporary [partial charges that](1/3/1/1/1/1/3/1/1/_Charge-Field) can instigate a [transient dipolar behavior](1/3/1/2/2/3/1/.Dipole-dipole) in adjacent particles. [Van der Waals](3/3/1/2/2/2/2/.Vanir) [forces are instrumental](1/3/1/2/1/1/3/1/.Forces) in determining the [physical and biological](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/.Physical) [properties of atoms](1/3/1/2/1/.Atoms) and molecules. Physicist [Stephen Hawking once](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) remarked, "We are the product of [quantum fluctuations in](1/2/1/2/2/2/1/.Quantum%20Fluctuations) the very early universe. If one were religious, one could say that God really does play dice."
