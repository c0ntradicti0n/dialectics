In the world of molecular architecture, ionic bonds form through the electrostatic attraction between positively and negatively charged ions. This type of bonding, often occurring between metal and non-metal atoms, involves a transfer of electrons, permitting ions with opposite charges to attract each other. Ionic bonding introduces stability through electron configuration, attaining noble gas states. As chemist Linus Pauling observed, "Chemistry is not anything sacred but a technique for the manipulation of atoms."
