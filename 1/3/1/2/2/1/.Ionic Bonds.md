In the world of molecular architecture, [ionic bonds form](1/3/1/2/2/1/.Ionic%20Bonds) [through the electrostatic](1/3/1/1/1/1/3/2/3/.Electrodynamics) [attraction between positively](2/2/2/2/3/2/_Attraction-Rejection) [and negatively charged](1/3/1/1/1/1/3/1/1/_Charge-Field) ions. This type of bonding, often [occurring between metal](3/1/1/1/1/2/1/1/.Metals) and non-metal atoms, involves a transfer of electrons, permitting [ions with opposite](1/1/3/2/2/3/2/3/.Neutral%20element%20e) charges to attract each other. Ionic [bonding introduces stability](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/3/.Bonding%20Theories) through electron configuration, [attaining noble gas](1/2/1/3/1/2/3/3/3/.Gas) states. As chemist Linus Pauling observed, ["Chemistry is not](1/3/1/2/2/.Molecules) anything sacred but a technique for the manipulation of atoms."
