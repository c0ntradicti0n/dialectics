Unlike ionic bonding, covalent bonding invokes a mutual electron sharing between two atoms, typically non-metal atoms, permitting each atoms to reach a noble gas electron configuration. Covalent bonds are pivotal to constructing stable molecules and compounds from component atoms. These bonds, though stronger than van der Waals forces, may be polar or nonpolar dependent on atom electronegativity. Nobel laureate Robert S. Mulliken pointed out, "In my view the structure of the atomic nucleus is not to be approached through a study of atomic spectra...."
