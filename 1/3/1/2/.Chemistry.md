[Chemistry is the](1/3/1/2/.Chemistry) study of matter, its properties, and its transformations. It [investigates the atomic](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Atomic) [and molecular constitution](1/3/1/2/2/.Molecules) of substances, revealing [how elements combine](3/2/2/1/1/1/.Elements) [and interact to](1/3/1/2/1/1/2/3/.Interactions) produce compounds. Chemistry [bridges the vast](3/1/3/3/1/1/3/3/.Infrastructure) [space between the](3/3/2/1/1/3/3/.White%20Space) [abstract laws of](3/2/2/3/1/3/.Supranational%20Law) [physics and the](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) tangible, often intricate [complexity of biological](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/3/.Complexity) systems. While it [builds upon the](2/1/1/3/2/2/2/.Built%20Structures) [principles established by](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) physics, it introduces [a level of](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/1/_Low-Level-High-Level) [specificity and intricate](2/3/1/2/3/_Qualitative-Quantitative) detail which, when [applied to the](1/1/3/2/2/1/2/3/.Examination) [realm of the](3/3/3/3/1/1/.Book%20of%20Revelation) living, gives birth [to the diverse](3/2/3/3/2/3/3/_Diversity-Unity) phenomenon of biology.
