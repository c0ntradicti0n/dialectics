Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, and its transformations. It investigates the atomic and molecular constitution of substances, revealing how elements combine and interact to produce compounds. Chemistry bridges the vast space between the abstract laws of physics and the tangible, often intricate complexity of biological systems. While it builds upon the principles established by physics, it introduces a level of specificity and intricate detail which, when applied to the realm of the living, gives birth to the diverse phenomenon of biology.
