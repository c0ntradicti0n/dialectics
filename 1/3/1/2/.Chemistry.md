[Chemistry is the](1/3/1/2/.Chemistry) study of matter, its properties, and its transformations. It [investigates the atomic](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Atomic) [and molecular constitution](1/3/1/2/2/.Molecules) of substances, revealing how elements combine and interact to produce compounds. Chemistry bridges the vast space between the [abstract laws of](3/2/2/3/1/3/.Supranational%20Law) [physics and the](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) tangible, often intricate [complexity of biological](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/3/.Complexity) systems. While it builds upon the principles established by physics, it introduces a level of specificity and intricate detail which, when applied to the realm of the living, gives birth to the diverse phenomenon of biology.
