[Conservation and transformation](1/3/1/_Conservation-Transformation) [are fundamental principles](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) that resonate through the fabric of the universe. Physics [reveals how energy](1/3/1/1/1/3/.Energy) [is conserved in](1/3/1/_Conservation-Transformation) interactions; Chemistry demonstrates [how atoms are](1/3/1/2/1/.Atoms) [conserved yet transformed](1/3/1/_Conservation-Transformation) into various compounds; [Biology showcases how](2/3/2/3/1/3/.Biology) [genetic information is](1/3/1/3/1/.Genetics) conserved across generations, even as it allows for the [transformative process of](3/3/3/_Manifestation-Transformation) evolution. The interplay between these two [principles underpins the](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) [dynamic equilibrium observed](2/2/2/1/3/1/.Equilibrium) in nature, reflecting [the eternal cycle](1/2/1/3/1/3/1/1/2/.Cycle) [of stability and](1/1/3/2/1/1/1/2/.Stability) change, continuity and novelty.
