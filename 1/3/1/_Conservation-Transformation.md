Conservation and transformation are fundamental principles that resonate through the fabric of the universe. Physics reveals how energy is conserved in interactions; Chemistry demonstrates how atoms are conserved yet transformed into various compounds; Biology showcases how genetic information is conserved across generations, even as it allows for the transformative process of evolution. The interplay between these two principles underpins the dynamic equilibrium observed in nature, reflecting the eternal cycle of stability and change, continuity and novelty.
