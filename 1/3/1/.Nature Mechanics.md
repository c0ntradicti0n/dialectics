[Nature follows its](1/3/1/.Nature%20Mechanics) inherent laws, constantly in motion, through [processes that encompass](3/1/1/2/2/2/1/1/1/2/2/1/.Process) physical, chemical, and biological interactions. These can be considered [the mechanics of](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Mechanics) nature, dictating every process that takes place within it, [governing the actions](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/2/2/.Regulation) of stars, the [movement of tectonic](1/3/2/1/.Plate%20Tectonics) plates, the flow of rivers, and [the metabolic processes](2/2/2/2/2/2/3/1/3/.'Chemical%20Reactions') inside organisms. Human [awareness and exploration](1/2/1/1/2/3/3/.Exploration) [of these mechanics](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Mechanics) gave birth to [sciences such as](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and ecology.
