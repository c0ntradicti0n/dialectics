Nature follows its inherent laws, constantly in motion, through processes that encompass physical, chemical, and biological interactions. These can be considered the mechanics of nature, dictating every process that takes place within it, governing the actions of stars, the movement of tectonic plates, the flow of rivers, and the metabolic processes inside organisms. Human awareness and exploration of these mechanics gave birth to sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and ecology.
