[Einstein's theory of](1/2/3/2/1/.Special%20Relativity) [relativity rejects the](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) [classical notion of](3/3/2/3/3/1/.Classical%20Foundations) [absolute space and](1/2/1/3/1/3/3/1/1/.Metric%20Space) time, suggesting instead that these are [relative and intertwined](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) [in a space-time](1/2/3/.Space-Time) continuum. Mass and [energy are revealed](1/3/1/1/1/3/.Energy) to be interchangeable, as articulated by [the famous equation](1/1/2/3/2/1/.Formula) E=mc^2. In the realm of high speeds or strong gravitational fields, time dilates, and space contracts. Simultaneity becomes relative, meaning that two events occurring simultaneously for one observer might not for another. This framework seamlessly addresses the massive, interstellar [scales and velocities](1/2/1/2/3/1/3/1/.Scale) [approaching the speed](1/1/3/2/1/2/1/1/.Speed) of light, where [classical physics fails](1/3/1/1/1/.Classical%20Physics) to maintain its accuracy.
