Space-time, an integrated four-dimensional framework, couples [three spatial dimensions](1/2/1/3/1/2/3/.Three%20Dimensions) with one temporal. Implied by relativity, [space and time](1/2/3/.Space-Time) lose absolute meaning, [intermingling and exhibiting](3/3/2/2/1/1/1/.Exposition) [differing manifestations contingent](3/1/1/2/2/_Manifestation-Interpretation) upon an observer's [relative velocity or](1/3/1/1/3/1/_Inertial-Relative) gravitational field. Establishing [this fascinating incongruity](1/2/1/3/1/1/3/1/1/.Paradoxes) [between classical intuition](2/1/3/2/_Abstract-Concrete) and modern physics, [merging space and](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/1/1/1/.T2%20Spaces) time inseparably, fundamentally [reshaped our understanding](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) of the universe. [As physicist Kip](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) Thorne commented, "Einstein's [gravitational waves weave](1/3/1/1/3/2/2/.Gravitational%20Waves) the fabric of [space and time](1/2/3/.Space-Time) around us and stretch the limits of human understanding."
