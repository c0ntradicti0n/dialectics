Einstein's General Theory of Relativity goes beyond its special counterpart by integrating gravity into the fabric of space-time, substituting force with geometrical curvature. This effectively translates the motion of objects to the geometry of space-time fabric, with massive objects bending this fabric to create a 'gravity well' that influences the movement of nearby particles. Newton's gravitational force is no longer needed, replaced by the bending of space-time geommetry. "I am enough of an artist," Einstein remarked, "to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."
