[Einstein's General Theory](1/3/1/1/3/2/.General%20Relativity) [of Relativity goes](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) [beyond its special](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/3/3/3/3/.Special%20Cases) counterpart by integrating [gravity into the](1/2/1/3/1/1/2/2/1/.Gravitational) fabric of space-time, [substituting force with](1/2/1/2/3/2/2/1/.Force) geometrical curvature. This effectively translates the [motion of objects](1/1/3/2/1/2/.Motion) [to the geometry](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) of space-time fabric, [with massive objects](1/3/1/1/3/2/2/.Gravitational%20Waves) [bending this fabric](1/3/1/2/3/3/2/1/1/2/1/3/.Bending) to create a ['gravity well' that](1/2/1/3/1/1/2/2/1/.Gravitational) influences the movement of nearby particles. [Newton's gravitational force](1/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Gravitational%20Pull) is no longer needed, replaced by [the bending of](1/3/1/2/3/3/2/1/1/2/1/3/.Bending) space-time geommetry. "I am enough of an artist," Einstein remarked, "to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."
