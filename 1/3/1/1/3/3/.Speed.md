[Speed can be](1/2/3/1/3/.Speed) [defined as the](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) [rate at which](1/1/3/2/1/2/1/3/.Rate) an object moves, with respect to time, across a relative base. This [motion phenomenon surfaces](1/1/3/2/3/2/1/1/.Surface) as the essential fulcrum across both the special and general theory of relativity. Interestingly, despite [speed's seemingly simple](1/2/3/1/3/.Speed) intuition, distortions occur at nearing the speed of light, [invoking time dilation](1/2/1/3/1/1/2/2/.Time%20Dilation) and length contraction. As Thomas Edison noted, "The man who figured out how to fix [the distance/time ratio](1/3/1/1/3/3/.Speed) would be a rich man indeed."
