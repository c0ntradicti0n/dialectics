Speed can be defined as the rate at which an object moves, with respect to time, across a relative base. This motion phenomenon surfaces as the essential fulcrum across both the special and general theory of relativity. Interestingly, despite speed's seemingly simple intuition, distortions occur at nearing the speed of light, invoking time dilation and length contraction. As Thomas Edison noted, "The man who figured out how to fix the distance/time ratio would be a rich man indeed."
