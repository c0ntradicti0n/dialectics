[Einstein's theory of](1/2/3/2/1/.Special%20Relativity) [Special Relativity introduces](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) [an immutable relationship](1/1/3/2/1/1/.Changeless) [between space and](1/1/3/2/3/2/2/2/.Space) time, dismantling the [Newtonian paradigm of](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Newtonian%20Mechanics) [absolute space and](1/2/1/3/1/3/3/1/1/.Metric%20Space) time. Essentially, special [relativity pertains to](1/3/1/1/3/1/.Special%20Relativity) [the physical phenomena](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) in uniform motion, [exhibiting the invariance](1/1/3/2/1/1/3/.Invariance) [of physical laws](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) [under transformations of](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) speed and direction. [The pivotal moment](1/2/2/3/2/.Moment) is instantiated by the realization that [the speed of](1/3/1/1/3/3/2/.Light%20Speed) light remains constant, regardless of the [observer's motion relative](1/2/3/2/3/3/.Relative%20Velocities) to its source. [Einstein encapsulated this](1/2/1/3/1/1/3/2/1/.Einstein-Rosen%20Bridges) phenomenon: "When you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think it's only a minute, but when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think it's two hours.
