Einstein's theory of Special Relativity introduces an immutable relationship between space and time, dismantling the Newtonian paradigm of absolute space and time. Essentially, special relativity pertains to the physical phenomena in uniform motion, exhibiting the invariance of physical laws under transformations of speed and direction. The pivotal moment is instantiated by the realization that the speed of light remains constant, regardless of the observer's motion relative to its source. Einstein encapsulated this phenomenon: "When you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think it's only a minute, but when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think it's two hours. That's relativity."
