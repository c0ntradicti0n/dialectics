Physics concerns itself with the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy in the universe. It delves into the interactions, forces, and relationships between particles, waves, and fields, striving to uncover the laws that underpin the observable universe. However, the complex dance of subatomic particles and cosmic bodies alike is inherently abstract, leaving room for deeper understanding, which paves the way for the realm of chemistry, where the very interactions identified by physics manifest in tangible, structured ways.
