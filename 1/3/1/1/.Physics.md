[Physics concerns itself](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) [with the fundamental](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/3/.Fundamental) [principles that govern](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) the behavior of [matter and energy](1/3/1/1/_Energy-Matter) in the universe. [It delves into](1/2/1/1/3/1/3/.Penetration) the interactions, forces, [and relationships between](1/3/1/3/1/3/.Ecological%20Relationships) particles, waves, and fields, striving to uncover the laws [that underpin the](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) observable universe. However, the complex dance [of subatomic particles](1/3/1/2/1/1/.Subatomic%20Particles) [and cosmic bodies](1/3/3/3/.Extraterrestrial%20Bodies) alike is inherently abstract, leaving room for deeper understanding, which paves the way for the realm of chemistry, where the very [interactions identified by](1/3/1/2/1/1/1/2/.Interactions) [physics manifest in](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) tangible, structured ways.
