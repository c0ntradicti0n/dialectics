Quantum Field Theory (QFT) endeavors to unite quantum mechanics and special relativity, offering a theoretical framework that underpins our understanding of the particle behavior and their interactions. QFT posits that the quantum fields propagate in the form of waves but interact in quantized packets called particles. Hence, rather than considering particles as distinct entities, QFT views them as excited states of the underlying field.
