Derived from the principles of quantum mechanics, Superposition epitomizes a state where particles can exist in multiple states at a given moment, embodying multiple potentialities. However, this bizarre status only holds till an observation is made. Upon measurement, the superposed state 'collapses' to one definitive state. Thus, Superposition allows us to explore the strange duality of reality as both deterministic and probabilistic.
