Derived from the [principles of quantum](1/2/1/2/2/1/1/.Quantum%20Characteristics) mechanics, Superposition epitomizes a state where [particles can exist](1/2/1/2/1/2/1/1/.Virtual%20Particles) in multiple states at a given moment, embodying multiple potentialities. However, this bizarre status only holds till an observation is made. Upon measurement, the [superposed state 'collapses'](1/3/1/1/2/3/_Collapsed-Entangled) to one definitive state. Thus, Superposition allows us to explore the strange [duality of reality](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) [as both deterministic](2/2/3/1/3/_Determinism-Randomness) and probabilistic.
