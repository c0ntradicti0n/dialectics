Quantum physics emerges from the microcosmic realm, where classical physics breaks down and deterministic laws give way to probabilities. At this scale, particles also manifest as waves, and the properties of particles—such as position and momentum—can only be defined in terms of probabilities. The act of measurement affects the state of the system, making the observer an integral part of the observed. This introduces intrinsic uncertainties, represented by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, disrupting the determinism championed by classical physics.
