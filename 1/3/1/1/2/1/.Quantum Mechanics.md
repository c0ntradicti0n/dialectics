Quantum mechanics explores the peculiar behaviors at the heart of particles, strongly disputing the deterministic picture of the universe. It introduces the incorporation of probability in predicting the behavior of particles, thus refuting absolute certainty. Through its principles such as the wave-particle duality and superposition, it paints a picture of reality that is highly counter-intuitive. "Quantum mechanics, the dreams stuff is made of." - David P. Anderson
