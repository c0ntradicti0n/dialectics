[Quantum mechanics explores](1/3/1/1/2/1/.Quantum%20Mechanics) [the peculiar behaviors](1/1/2/3/3/_Repeating-Random) at the heart of particles, strongly [disputing the deterministic](2/2/3/1/3/_Determinism-Randomness) picture of the universe. It introduces the incorporation of probability in predicting the behavior of particles, thus refuting absolute certainty. Through [its principles such](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) [as the wave-particle](1/3/1/1/1/2/_Wave-Particle) duality and superposition, it paints a [picture of reality](2/1/2/3/1/3/.Realism) that is highly counter-intuitive. "Quantum mechanics, the dreams stuff is made of." - David P. Anderson
