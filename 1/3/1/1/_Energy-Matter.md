Energy and matter, once seen as distinct entities in classical physics, become deeply intertwined in [both quantum mechanics](1/3/1/1/2/_Particle-Wave) and relativity. Quantum mechanics introduces the [concept of wave-particle](1/3/1/1/1/2/_Wave-Particle) duality, where entities [like photons possess](1/3/1/1/1/2/1/2/.Light%20Waves) [both particle-like and](1/2/1/2/1/2/1/1/.Virtual%20Particles) wave-like characteristics. In relativity, the conversion [between energy and](1/3/1/1/1/3/.Energy) matter becomes evident. This antinomic mutual [relation between energy)))](1/3/1/1/1/3/.Energy) [and matter highlights](3/3/2/1/1/2/3/.Complementary%20Colors) a profound realizationâ€”what we once viewed as separate, opposing [entities are in](3/3/3/1/3/3/_Inanimate-Alive) [fact different manifestations](3/1/1/2/2/_Manifestation-Interpretation) of the same underlying reality.
