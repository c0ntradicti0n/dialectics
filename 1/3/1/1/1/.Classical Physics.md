Classical physics posits a deterministic universe, where events and processes are governed by laws that, given initial conditions, can be precisely predicted. Rooted in the macroscopic world, it is characterized by Newton's laws of motion, Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, and thermodynamics. These laws work seamlessly in the realm of our everyday experience, dealing with tangible, observable phenomena. Objects possess inherent properties—mass, position, velocity—and evolve in an environment of absolute space and time.
