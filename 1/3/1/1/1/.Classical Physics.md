[Classical physics posits](1/3/1/1/1/.Classical%20Physics) a deterministic universe, [where events and](1/2/2/3/3/1/.Event) [processes are governed](3/2/3/1/2/2/1/_Autonomy-Dependency) by laws that, given initial conditions, [can be precisely](1/1/3/2/2/2/_Exact-Approximate) predicted. Rooted in the macroscopic world, [it is characterized](2/3/3/1/2/_Prescriptive-Descriptive) [by Newton's laws](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/.Newtonian%20Mechanics) of motion, Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, and thermodynamics. These [laws work seamlessly](3/2/2/3/1/3/.Supranational%20Law) [in the realm](1/2/1/1/2/.Place) [of our everyday](1/2/2/3/1/.Today) experience, dealing with tangible, observable phenomena. [Objects possess inherent](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) properties—mass, position, velocity—and [evolve in an](1/1/3/2/1/3/2/.Evolution) [environment of absolute](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/1/3/2/.Absolute%20Complement) space and time.
