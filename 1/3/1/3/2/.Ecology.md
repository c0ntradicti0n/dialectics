Ecology focuses on the relationships between organisms and their environments, encompassing both biotic interactions (among living entities) and abiotic factors (like temperature, water availability, and sunlight). It aims to elucidate the distribution, abundance, and interactions of living organisms, revealing patterns and explaining processes at various scalesâ€”from microscopic interactions to global biogeochemical cycles. While genetics offers a microscopic view of life through the lens of DNA, ecology provides a macroscopic view, underscoring the importance of community, population dynamics, and ecosystems. However, in contrast to the static impression of individual organisms in their niches, ecology also underscores the dynamic interactions and constant evolution of ecosystems over time. dynamic interactions and constant evolution of ecosystems over time. dynamic interactions and constant evolution of ecosystems over time. dynamic interactions and constant evolution of ecosystems over time. dynamic interactions and constant evolution of ecosystems over time. dynamic interactions and constant evolution of ecosystems over time. dynamic interactions and constant evolution of ecosystems over time. dynamic interactions and constant evolution of ecosystems over time.
