Contrasting replication, death [signifies the cessation](1/2/2/3/1/3/.Dusk) [of vital biological](2/3/2/3/1/3/.Biology) processes within an organism, terminating its existence and removing [its genetic blueprint](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/.Genetics) from impacting future generations directly. It [forms life's inevitable](1/3/1/3/2/_Static-Evolution) antithesis, contributing to [natural selection as](1/3/1/3/3/2/2/.Natural%20Selection) it clears the stage for younger, potentially more adapted organisms. However, death can also promote evolution, as advantageous [genes survive within](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/1/.DNA) the gene pool. [As Charles Darwin](1/3/1/3/3/.Evolution) stated, "It is not the strongest [of the species](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/2/3/3/.Biodiversity) that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change."
