Contrasting replication, death signifies the cessation of vital biological processes within an organism, terminating its existence and removing its genetic blueprint from impacting future generations directly. It forms life's inevitable antithesis, contributing to natural selection as it clears the stage for younger, potentially more adapted organisms. However, death can also promote evolution, as advantageous genes survive within the gene pool. As Charles Darwin stated, "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change."
