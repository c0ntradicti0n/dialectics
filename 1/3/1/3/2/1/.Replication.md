[In the biological](2/3/2/3/1/3/.Biology) sphere, replication signifies [the duplication of](1/3/1/3/2/1/.Replication) [genetic material within](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/1/.DNA) [a living organism](1/3/1/3/1/2/.Organismic%20Biology) to pass it on to the subsequent generation. This mechanism, vital for life continuity, obeys the reproduction imperative, constructing identical or [near-identical copies of](1/2/1/3/1/3/1/_Identical-Different) [the organism's genetic](1/3/1/3/1/.Genetics) blueprint. However, replication can sometimes err, leading to mutations, which provide the raw material for evolution. French biologist Jacques Monod captured the essence of this: "Life has only the properties [of replicating and](1/3/1/3/2/1/.Replication) evolving."
