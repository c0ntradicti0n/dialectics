In the biological sphere, replication signifies the duplication of genetic material within a living organism to pass it on to the subsequent generation. This mechanism, vital for life continuity, obeys the reproduction imperative, constructing identical or near-identical copies of the organism's genetic blueprint. However, replication can sometimes err, leading to mutations, which provide the raw material for evolution. French biologist Jacques Monod captured the essence of this: "Life has only the properties of replicating and evolving."
