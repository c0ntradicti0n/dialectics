Life embodies a beautiful paradox, oscillating between change (evolution) and stasis (static). Survival often requires adaptation, driving evolution forward, while static genetics hold essential functions intact. Replication lies at this axis, equilibrating the static and evolutionary impulses. Death, the anti-thesis of birth and growth, ushers in change by making room for the next generation's evolution, hence sustaining the matrix of life. D'Arcy Thompson said it best: "Everything is the way it is because it got that way."
