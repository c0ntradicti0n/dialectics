[Life embodies a](3/3/.Cultural%20Embodiment) beautiful paradox, oscillating [between change (evolution)](1/3/1/3/3/.Evolution) and stasis (static). [Survival often requires](2/1/1/.Life%20in%20Raw%20Environment) adaptation, driving evolution forward, while static [genetics hold essential](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/.Genetics) functions intact. Replication lies at this axis, equilibrating the [static and evolutionary](1/3/1/3/2/_Static-Evolution) impulses. Death, the [anti-thesis of birth](2/1/1/2/2/2/3/3/3/.Birth) and growth, ushers in change by making room for the next generation's evolution, hence sustaining [the matrix of](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/3/3/.Matrix) life. D'Arcy Thompson said it best: "Everything is the [way it is](1/1/3/3/1/3/3/.Approach) because it got that way."
