Natural selection, the evolutionary force crafting species over successive generations, ensures the survival and proliferation of the fittest entities. Replication errors (mutations), environmental pressures, and finite resources cooperatively synthesize this mechanism. Those organisms best adapted to survive will propagate their genetic material, indirectly guiding their species' evolution. Richard Dawkins summarized this eloquently, "Natural selection is all about the differential survival of self-replicating entities."
