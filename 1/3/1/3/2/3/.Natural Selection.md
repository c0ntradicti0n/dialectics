Natural selection, the [evolutionary force crafting](1/3/1/3/2/3/.Natural%20Selection) [species over successive](2/1/1/2/2/2/_Reproduction-Continuation) generations, ensures the [survival and proliferation](1/3/1/3/2/_Static-Evolution) [of the fittest](3/2/3/3/3/1/.Aristocracy) entities. Replication errors (mutations), environmental pressures, and finite resources cooperatively synthesize this mechanism. Those organisms best adapted to [survive will propagate](1/2/1/1/3/2/2/2/.Adaptation) their genetic material, indirectly guiding their species' evolution. Richard [Dawkins summarized this](1/3/1/3/2/3/.Natural%20Selection) eloquently, "Natural selection is all about [the differential survival](1/3/1/3/3/2/.Adaptive%20Mechanisms) of self-replicating entities."
