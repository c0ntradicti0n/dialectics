It seeks to understand the mechanisms that govern the growth, development, reproduction, and evolution of living organisms. [From the microscopic](1/3/1/3/1/1/1/.Cellular%20Biology) [realm of cellular](1/3/1/3/1/1/1/.Cellular%20Biology) processes to the [vast ecosystems of](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/2/3/1/.Ecosystems) our planet, biology [encompasses the breadth](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) of life. While it operates within the parameters set by physics and chemistry, biology introduces an unprecedented level of complexity, resulting from the interplay between genetic codes, metabolic pathways, and environmental influences. This intricate dance of [life is both](3/3/2/2/2/1/2/.Life%20and%20Death) a product and a perpetuator of the conservation and [transformation processes intrinsic](1/3/1/_Conservation-Transformation) to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature. to nature.
