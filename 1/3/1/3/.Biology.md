Biology, the study of life, encompasses a vast array of scales, from individual molecules within cells to entire ecosystems. It seeks to understand the mechanisms, structures, and evolution of living organisms, revealing life's beautiful complexity. Biology perceives life not as isolated entities but as interconnected systems evolving and adapting through time. Yet, understanding life forms individually doesn't provide a holistic picture. The essence of existence lies in understanding the intricate dance between parts and their sum, hinting towards the relationship between individual entities and their collective whole.
