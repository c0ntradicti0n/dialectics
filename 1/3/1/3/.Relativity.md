Einstein's theory of relativity rejects the classical notion of absolute space and time, suggesting instead that these are relative and intertwined in a space-time continuum. Mass and energy are revealed to be interchangeable, as articulated by the famous equation E=mc^2. In the realm of high speeds or strong gravitational fields, time dilates, and space contracts. Simultaneity becomes relative, meaning that two events occurring simultaneously for one observer might not for another. This framework seamlessly addresses the massive, interstellar scales and velocities approaching the speed of light, where classical physics fails to maintain its accuracy.
