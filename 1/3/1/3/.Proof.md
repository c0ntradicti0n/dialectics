Proof is the synthesis of a proposition and an argument. It is a demonstration that certain premises logically lead to a particular conclusion, thereby confirming the truth of the proposition. In essence, proof is the process of establishing truth beyond doubt, by using logical arguments derived from established truths or axioms. In this way, proof sublates the contradiction between the proposition and the argument, embodying their unity and demonstrating the truth or falsity of the initial proposition. Proof concludes the dialectical process of logical reasoning, moving the process from uncertainty to certainty.
