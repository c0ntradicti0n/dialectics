[Genetics is the](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/.Genetics) [scientific study of](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) [heredity and variation](1/3/1/3/1/_Heredity-Variation) in organisms. It [seeks to comprehend](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [the fundamental mechanisms](1/3/1/3/3/2/.Adaptive%20Mechanisms) [by which organisms](1/3/1/3/1/2/.Organismic%20Biology) [inherit features from](3/2/3/3/1/3/1/_Ancestor-Descendant) their ancestors, manifesting [in traits such](1/3/1/3/1/_Heredity-Variation) as physical characteristics, behavioral tendencies, and [susceptibilities to certain](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/.Genetics) health conditions. Genetics [operates at the](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/1/1/.Retail) molecular level, emphasizing [the role of](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [DNA and genes](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/1/.DNA) [in determining the](3/3/1/3/1/1/_Proof-Unknown) [sequence of amino](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/.Sequence) acids in proteins, which in turn, express specific phenotypes. Nevertheless, genetics cannot [be understood in](2/1/3/3/2/2/.Understanding) isolation, as it [interacts dynamically with](3/1/1/3/2/3/.Interaction%20Bots) environmental factors, culminating [in an organism's](2/3/2/3/1/3/.Biology) [phenotypeâ€”leading to the](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/.Genetics) [intricate balance of](2/2/2/1/3/3/1/2/.Aesthetics%20of%20Balance) heredity and variation.
