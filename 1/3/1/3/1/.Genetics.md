[Genetics is the](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/.Genetics) [scientific study of](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) [heredity and variation](1/3/1/3/1/_Heredity-Variation) in organisms. It seeks to comprehend [the fundamental mechanisms](2/3/1/3/2/1/.Mechanistic%20Causation) [by which organisms](1/3/2/2/2/1/.Photosynthesis) [inherit features from](3/1/1/2/3/1/1/1/2/.Feature%20Extraction) their ancestors, manifesting [in traits such](1/3/1/3/1/_Heredity-Variation) as physical characteristics, behavioral tendencies, and susceptibilities to certain health conditions. Genetics operates at the molecular level, emphasizing the role of [DNA and genes](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/1/.DNA) in determining the sequence of amino acids in proteins, which in turn, express specific phenotypes. Nevertheless, genetics cannot be understood in isolation, as it interacts dynamically with environmental factors, culminating [in an organism's](2/3/2/3/1/3/.Biology) [phenotypeâ€”leading to the](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/3/.Genetics) intricate balance of heredity and variation.
