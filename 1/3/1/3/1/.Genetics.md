Genetics is the scientific study of heredity and variation in organisms. It seeks to comprehend the fundamental mechanisms by which organisms inherit features from their ancestors, manifesting in traits such as physical characteristics, behavioral tendencies, and susceptibilities to certain health conditions. Genetics operates at the molecular level, emphasizing the role of DNA and genes in determining the sequence of amino acids in proteins, which in turn, express specific phenotypes. Nevertheless, genetics cannot be understood in isolation, as it interacts dynamically with environmental factors, culminating in an organism's phenotypeâ€”leading to the intricate balance of heredity and variation.
