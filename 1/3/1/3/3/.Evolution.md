[Evolution captures the](1/3/1/3/3/.Evolution) [transformative journey of](3/3/2/2/2/2/1/.Hero's%20Journey) [life over geological](1/3/2/1/2/_Creation-Destruction) timescales, predicated on the principle of descent with modification. It reveals how, through processes like mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and most prominently, natural selection, organisms change over generations, leading to speciation, adaptation, and sometimes extinction. [Evolution is integrally](1/3/1/3/3/.Evolution) connected to genetics, [as genetic variations](1/3/1/3/1/_Heredity-Variation) serve as the raw material upon [which evolutionary processes](1/1/3/2/1/3/2/.Evolution) act. At the same time, ecological factors often drive the direction and pace of evolution, [as organisms adapt](1/3/1/3/_Static-Dynamic) in response to their environmental contexts. Thus, evolution acts as a bridge, [synthesizing genetic mechanisms](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [and ecological dynamics](1/3/1/3/2/.Ecology) into a coherent [narrative of life's](3/3/2/2/.Narrative%20Shapes) [history and future](2/3/2/3/3/1/.History) potentialities. and ecological [dynamics into a](2/3/2/2/1/1/.Dynamics) [coherent narrative of](3/3/2/2/.Narrative%20Shapes) [life's history and](2/3/2/3/3/1/.History) future potentialities. and [ecological dynamics into](1/3/1/3/1/3/.Ecological%20Relationships) [a coherent narrative](3/3/2/2/.Narrative%20Shapes) [of life's history](2/3/2/3/3/1/.History) and future potentialities.
