Speciation, synthesizing the conflict of origin theories and adaptive mechanisms, embodies the process where new genetic lines and species emerge due to evolutionary pressures. It validates the dialectical relationship between the abstract nature of origin theories and the concrete mechanisms of adaptation. Speciation emphasizes diversification resulting from genetic modifications over millions of years, offering a resolution to the initial disputation and upholding the universality of life's diversity and evolving dynamics.
