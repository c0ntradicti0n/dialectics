Physics is the fundamental science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. It seeks to understand and explain the physical universe in terms of fundamental principles and laws. As the study of matter in motion, physics essentially presents the thesis of the dialectical structure of nature. It aims to ascertain the fundamental laws that govern the universe, and it does so by focusing on the simplest and most universal aspects of reality - those concerning energy, force, space, time, and matter.
