Physics is the foundational science exploring the most basic principles governing the universe, from vast cosmic scales to minuscule subatomic particles. By unraveling the laws of nature, it seeks to understand the underlying relationships between space, time, energy, and matter. However, when these principles are studied in isolation, the wholeness and interconnectedness of the universe are overlooked. This calls for an integration with Chemistry, which delves into matter's nature and interactions on a molecular and atomic level.
