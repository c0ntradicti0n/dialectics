Physics is the branch of science that seeks to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy in the universe. It encompasses various subfields, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and relativity. Physics strives to uncover the underlying laws and forces that shape the natural world and enable us to explain and predict the behavior of physical phenomena.
