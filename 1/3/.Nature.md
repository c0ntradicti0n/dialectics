[Nature encompasses the](1/3/.Nature) entirety of the [physical world and](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/.Physical) its phenomena, governed [by fundamental laws](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) and principles. It is both the sum of individual entities—like atoms, molecules, [and organisms—and the](1/3/1/3/1/2/.Organismic%20Biology) [collective processes and](3/2/3/1/3/_Collective-Individual) systems they constitute, [such as weather](1/2/2/2/1/1/1/.Weather) patterns, ecosystems, and galaxies. Nature, in its vastness, demonstrates [the interplay of](1/3/1/2/1/1/1/2/.Interactions) stability and change, complexity and simplicity, and chaos and order.
