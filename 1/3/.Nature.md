Nature encompasses the entirety of the physical world and its phenomena, governed by fundamental laws and principles. It is both the sum of individual entities—like atoms, molecules, and organisms—and the collective processes and systems they constitute, such as weather patterns, ecosystems, and galaxies. Nature, in its vastness, demonstrates the interplay of stability and change, complexity and simplicity, and chaos and order.
