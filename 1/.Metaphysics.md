Metaphysics, as a branch of philosophy, probes into the nature of existence, reality, and the cosmos, endeavoring to unveil the fundamental structures and principles that undergird the phenomenal world. This investigation examines dimensions beyond empirical observation and seeks to discern the foundational aspects of existence, including the nature of reality, the self, and the universe, and the interrelationships therein.
