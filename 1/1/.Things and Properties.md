Things are primary entities or objects of consideration. They can exist independently and have intrinsic properties. Properties, on the other hand, are the qualities or characteristics attributed to these things, determining their nature and distinguishing them from other entities. Together, things and their properties provide a foundational understanding of the world, allowing us to categorize, describe, and interact with our surroundings. The relationship between things and properties creates a dynamic framework where properties act both as identifiers for specific things and as the basis for broader classifications.
