[Things are primary](1/1/2/.Primary%20Categories) [entities or objects](1/1/.Things%20and%20Properties) of consideration. They can exist independently [and have intrinsic](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) properties. Properties, on the other hand, [are the qualities](2/2/1/1/.Virtue%20Qualities) [or characteristics attributed](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) to these things, [determining their nature](1/1/3/3/2/2/1/.Classification) [and distinguishing them](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/3/_Homogeneous-Heterogeneous) from other entities. Together, things and [their properties provide](1/1/.Things%20and%20Properties) [a foundational understanding](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) of the world, allowing us to categorize, describe, and interact with our surroundings. The relationship [between things and](1/2/3/.Space-Time) [properties creates a](1/1/.Things%20and%20Properties) dynamic framework where [properties act both](1/1/.Things%20and%20Properties) as identifiers for [specific things and](1/2/1/1/3/3/1/_General-Specific) [as the basis](1/3/1/2/3/1/2/.Bases) for broader classifications.
