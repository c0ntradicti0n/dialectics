[An arrangement is](1/1/3/3/1/1/1/.Arrangement) a specific instance of order, the concrete realization of [an abstract organization](1/1/3/3/1/3/.Organization) principle. It represents [a layout or](1/1/3/3/1/1/2/.Layout) [configuration devised for](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/_Design-Implementation) a particular purpose or to fulfill specific conditions. This could range from aesthetic considerations in [art to functional](3/1/1/1/1/2/3/3/1/2/.Functional%20Art) requirements in engineering. An apt remark in this context comes from Steve Jobs, "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. [Design is how](1/1/3/3/1/1/3/.Design) it works."
