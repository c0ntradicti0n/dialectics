An arrangement is a specific instance of order, the concrete realization of an abstract organization principle. It represents a layout or configuration devised for a particular purpose or to fulfill specific conditions. This could range from aesthetic considerations in art to functional requirements in engineering. An apt remark in this context comes from Steve Jobs, "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."
