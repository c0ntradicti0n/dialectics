[Organization takes arrangement](1/1/3/3/1/2/.Arrangement) to its logical conclusion and signifies [the systematic management](3/1/3/3/1/2/3/2/3/.Rehabilitative) [or coordination of](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/.Coordination%20Compounds) parts to meet a specific goal or purpose. Beyond mere arrangement, organization [incorporates the dynamics](2/3/2/2/1/1/.Dynamics) [of systems and](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) [focuses on how](2/1/2/3/2/1/.Deficit%20Focus) components interact and function together. According to the management guru Peter Drucker, ["Management is doing](1/1/3/3/1/3/.Organization) things right; leadership is doing the right things."
