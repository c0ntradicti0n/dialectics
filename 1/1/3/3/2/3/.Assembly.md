Assembly denotes the culmination of the processes of selection and grouping. This stage involves integrating different groups to construct a complex structure or system. The action of assembly embodies the reconciliation of selected groupings, facilitating a higher order unity that transcends its constituent parts, and displaying emergent properties in turn.

"Every act of creation is first an act of destruction", said Pablo Picasso, underlining the inherent interplay of deconstruction and reformation integral to assembly.
