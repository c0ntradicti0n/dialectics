This [stage involves integrating](1/1/3/1/2/2/3/.Integration) different groups to construct a complex structure or system. [The action of](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/_Action-Reaction) [assembly embodies the](3/1/3/3/1/2/1/1/2/.Assembly) [reconciliation of selected](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/3/3/2/.Choosing%20u%20and%20dv) groupings, facilitating a higher order unity that transcends its constituent parts, and displaying emergent properties in turn.

"Every act of [creation is first](3/3/3/1/.Creation%20Myths) [an act of](3/2/2/1/2/1/2/1/_Planning-Acting) destruction", said Pablo Picasso, underlining the [inherent interplay of](1/3/1/3/1/3/_Interaction-Isolation) [deconstruction and reformation](3/3/2/1/2/2/1/.Deconstructivism) integral to assembly.
