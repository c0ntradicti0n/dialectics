Combinations, unlike their cousin permutations, prioritise the selection over sequence. They eschew the notion of order, focusing instead on the manner of grouping within a distinct collection. Best regarded as subsets of a larger pool, combinations illuminate the relational nature of mathematics, underpinned by notions of grouping, choosing, and variation. Combinations instil a measures of flexibility to the structure of combinatorics, emphasizing the concept of choice.

"Chance - the possibility of a variation." - Friedrich Nietzsche
