Combinations, unlike their cousin permutations, prioritise the selection over sequence. They eschew [the notion of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) order, focusing instead on the manner [of grouping within](1/1/3/3/2/2/.Grouping) a distinct collection. Best regarded as [subsets of a](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/1/_Subset-Superset) larger pool, combinations [illuminate the relational](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) nature of mathematics, [underpinned by notions](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) of grouping, choosing, and variation. Combinations instil a measures of flexibility to the structure of combinatorics, emphasizing the concept of choice.

"Chance - the possibility of a variation." - Friedrich [Nietzsche](3/3/1/3/2/1/3/.Nietzsche's%20Overman)
