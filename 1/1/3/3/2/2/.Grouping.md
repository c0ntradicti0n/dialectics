Grouping signifies the phase in logical processing types where selected elements are arranged into clusters based on certain parameters or conditions. This involves recognizing patterns and drawing parallels between objects, a capacity integral to the cognitive process. Grouping also carries the inherent potential for conflict, considering the ever-present temptation to impose artificial boundaries and simplistic categorical distinctions.

As Carl Jung professed, "In all chaos, there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order".
