[Grouping signifies the](1/1/3/3/2/2/.Grouping) [phase in logical](3/3/3/3/2/2/1/1/.Ascending%20Phase) processing types where selected elements are [arranged into clusters](1/1/3/3/1/1/1/.Arrangement) based on certain parameters or conditions. This involves recognizing patterns and drawing parallels between objects, a capacity integral [to the cognitive](2/1/3/3/1/3/.Cognitive) process. Grouping also carries the inherent potential for conflict, considering the ever-present temptation to impose [artificial boundaries and](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) simplistic categorical distinctions.

[As Carl Jung](3/3/2/1/2/2/1/.Deconstructivism) professed, "In all chaos, there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order".
