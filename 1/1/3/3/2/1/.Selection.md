The concept of selection represents the linguistic model or mechanism by which choice is performed. As a premise in the realm of cultural embodiment, selection emerges as the basis upon which differentiation manifests. It is the process that initiates distinction and separation, forming the bedrock for a multitude of subsequent processes, such as categorization and prioritization. Yet, selection also inherently embraces the condition of non-selection, marking what is left out or overlooked.

John F. Kennedy once stated: "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard."
