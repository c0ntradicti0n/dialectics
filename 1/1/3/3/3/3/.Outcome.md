[Outcome symbolizes the](1/1/3/3/3/3/.Outcome) [tangible manifestation resulting](1/1/3/1/1/2/1/.Tangible) from the interplay [of chance and](3/1/3/2/1/_Skill-Chance) likelihood. It represents a state where the processes of selection, grouping, and assembly coalesce, dictated by previously established conditions as well as elements of spontaneity. The concept [of outcome embodies](1/1/3/3/3/3/.Outcome) both the predictable [and unpredictable paradigms](1/1/2/3/3/_Repeating-Random) of existence.

In the words of Winston Churchill, “the price of greatness is responsibility.”
