Outcome symbolizes the tangible manifestation resulting from the interplay of chance and likelihood. It represents a state where the processes of selection, grouping, and assembly coalesce, dictated by previously established conditions as well as elements of spontaneity. The concept of outcome embodies both the predictable and unpredictable paradigms of existence.

In the words of Winston Churchill, “the price of greatness is responsibility.”
