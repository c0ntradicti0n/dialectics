[Probability perches on](1/1/3/3/3/2/1/.Probability) [the precipice between](3/3/3/3/_Before-During-After) chaos and order, [encompassing the prevailing](1/2/1/1/3/_All-encompassing) [uncertainty within mathematical](1/1/3/3/3/2/3/.Uncertainty) reality. A measure [of the likelihood](1/1/3/3/3/1/1/.Likelihood) of an event, it's a characteristic that amplifies the aleatoric element in combinatorics. The delicate [balance between chance](1/1/3/3/3/2/1/.Probability) [and certainty finds](1/1/3/3/3/2/2/.Certainty) expression in probability, facilitating the navigation [of risk and](2/1/2/3/2/2/.Risk%20Aversion) randomness. Probabilistic thinking [extends beyond pure](3/1/1/1/1/2/1/1/_Pure-Mixed) mathematics, permeating every realm of human endeavor.

"Einstein said God does not play [dice with the](1/2/1/3/2/1/3/.Roll) universe. But that doesn't mean you can't." - Stephen [Hawking](1/3/1/1/3/2/1/_Black%20Hole-Horizon)
