Algebra represents the antithesis to wholeness. It emphasizes the analysis and manipulation of individual variables within mathematical structures, often neglecting their systemic interdependencies. This approach is characterized by abstraction, symbolization, and generalization, enabling the formulation of equations and laws. It provides a powerful toolset for isolating variables and understanding the rules that govern their behavior. Yet, while it gives us control over the components, it tends to disregard their collective behavior, leading to the synthesis, combinatorics.
