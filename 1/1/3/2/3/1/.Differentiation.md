[Differentiation is the](1/1/3/2/2/3/2/2/.Differentiation) process of breaking down a whole into more manageable, [distinct parts to](1/1/3/1/2/2/_Whole-Parts) [comprehend their individual](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) roles and interrelationships. [It's a principle](3/2/2/3/3/2/.Principles) [of demarcation that](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/3/.Boundaries) aids in identifying [unique aspects of](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) a complex entity. [This analytical process](2/3/1/2/1/3/.Analysis) is core to many scientific disciplines, [from biology to](2/3/2/3/1/3/.Biology) mathematics, allowing for a more intricate [understanding of complex](1/2/1/1/1/3/3/3/.Complex%20Structure) systems. A popular quote attributed to Albert Einstein relates to this: "Not everything that can be counted counts, [and not everything](1/2/1/1/3/3/3/.All-encompassing) that counts can be counted."
