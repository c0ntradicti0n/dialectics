Differentiation is the process of breaking down a whole into more manageable, distinct parts to comprehend their individual roles and interrelationships. It's a principle of demarcation that aids in identifying unique aspects of a complex entity. This analytical process is core to many scientific disciplines, from biology to mathematics, allowing for a more intricate understanding of complex systems. A popular quote attributed to Albert Einstein relates to this: "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."
