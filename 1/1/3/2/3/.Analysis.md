Analysis, in a Hegelian sense, can be construed as deconstruction of a structure or a concept, enabling a thorough understanding of its constituent parts and their interrelations. It serves as a counterpoint to synthesis, where separate entities are combined to construct a new comprehensive whole. In a mathematical context, analysis uncovers the inherent properties of mathematical objects, exposing their complex interconnections and intriguing hierarchical relations.
