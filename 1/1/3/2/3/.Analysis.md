Analysis, in a Hegelian sense, can be construed as [deconstruction of a](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/2/_Reconstruction-Deconstruction) [structure or a](1/1/3/3/1/2/2/.Structure) concept, enabling a [thorough understanding of](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [its constituent parts](1/1/3/1/2/_Primitive-Composite) and their interrelations. It serves as a counterpoint to synthesis, where separate entities are combined to construct a new comprehensive whole. [In a mathematical](1/2/1/2/2/3/1/.Mathematical%20Concept) context, analysis uncovers [the inherent properties](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) of mathematical objects, [exposing their complex](3/1/2/3/1/3/2/.Responsible%20disclosure) [interconnections and intriguing](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) hierarchical relations.
