The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, a pivotal concept in mathematical analysis, binds differentiation and integration into a single framework. It establishes a precise inverse relationship between the two processes, stating that integration of a function over an interval yields a net 'change' â€” a concept measured by differentiation. Moreover, symbolically, it amalgamates the concept of local change (differentiation) with the cumulative total (integration), offering a deep understanding of continuity and change within a system.
