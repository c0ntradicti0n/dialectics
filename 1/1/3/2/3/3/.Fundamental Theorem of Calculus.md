[The Fundamental Theorem](1/1/3/2/3/3/.Fundamental%20Theorem%20of%20Calculus) of Calculus, a [pivotal concept in](1/1/3/1/2/1/.Singularity) mathematical analysis, binds [differentiation and integration](1/1/3/2/3/3/_Differentiation-Integration) into a single framework. It establishes [a precise inverse](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/.Inverse%20Operations) relationship between the two processes, stating [that integration of](1/1/3/2/2/3/2/1/.Integration) [a function over](2/2/2/_Function-Form) [an interval yields](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/3/.Interval) a net 'change' [â€” a concept](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) measured by differentiation. Moreover, symbolically, it [amalgamates the concept](1/1/3/2/3/2/3/2/.Aggregation) [of local change](1/1/2/2/.Change) [(differentiation) with the](1/1/3/2/2/3/2/2/.Differentiation) cumulative total (integration), offering a deep [understanding of continuity](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/2/.Continuity) [and change within](2/2/3/2/3/3/.Change%20and%20Permanence) a system.
