Integration is the opposing counterpart of differentiation, unifying disparate or distinct elements into a coherent whole. The concept embodies the process of creating connections, similarity, unity, and wholeness. It's crucial in perceiving patterns, making sense of diverse information, and building comprehensive models or theories. In essence, integration serves as the fuel for synthesis. Henry Ford once stated, "Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is success," which cleverly signifies the process of integration.
