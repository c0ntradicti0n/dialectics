[The antinomic mutual](2/2/2/1/_Organic-Inorganic) [connection between differentiation](1/1/3/2/2/3/2/2/.Differentiation) [(Decomposition) and Integration](1/1/3/2/3/_Decomposition-Integration) [defines the underlying](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) [rhythm of scientific](2/3/2/3/1/.Sciences) inquiry. It relates especially to the [process of simplification](1/3/1/2/3/3/1/2/3/2/.Reduction) [and subsequent recombination](2/1/1/2/2/2/_Reproduction-Continuation) [to derive meaning](1/1/3/2/1/.Derivation) or to solve complex problems. By differentiating, we dissect [a system into](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) [constituent parts to](1/1/3/1/2/2/_Whole-Parts) [study their fundamental](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/3/.Fundamental) mechanisms. But integral [to understanding the](2/2/1/1/3/2/.Understanding) [system as a](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) [whole is the](1/2/1/1/3/3/3/3/.Whole) act of integration, which links these separated elements back together, illuminating the [interplay of the](1/3/1/3/1/3/_Interaction-Isolation) [parts within the](1/3/_Whole-Parts) [framework of the](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/.Frameworks) whole.
