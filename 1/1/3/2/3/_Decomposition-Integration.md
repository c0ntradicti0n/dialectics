The antinomic mutual connection between differentiation (Decomposition) and Integration defines the underlying rhythm of scientific inquiry. It relates especially to the process of simplification and subsequent recombination to derive meaning or to solve complex problems. By differentiating, we dissect a system into constituent parts to study their fundamental mechanisms. But integral to understanding the system as a whole is the act of integration, which links these separated elements back together, illuminating the interplay of the parts within the framework of the whole.
