Calculation, in its dialectical essence, can [be observed as](2/1/1/3/3/2/.Observing) [a methodical procedure](1/1/3/2/2/1/1/1/.Procedure) to arrive at a desired result. [This involves systematic](2/1/3/2/2/3/.Procedural) [operational manipulation of](3/1/2/1/1/_Direct-Manipulation) [mathematical expressions in](1/1/2/3/2/1/.Formula) [accordance with established](2/2/2/3/2/3/.Appeal%20to%20Authority) rules. Yet, this [calculation invariably relies](1/1/3/2/2/.Calculate) on countable numbers, [thereby creating a](1/1/3/3/3/3/2/.Consequence) [tension with notions](3/3/2/2/3/3/.Themes%20and%20Interpretations) [that inherently surpass](1/1/2/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) countability, such as infinity or infinitesimals.
