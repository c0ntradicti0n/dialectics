Countable and uncountable, [as antinomic mutual](2/2/2/1/_Organic-Inorganic) relations, reflect the [nature of our](2/3/3/.Human%20Endeavors) [cognition and forms](2/1/3/2/3/_Sensation-Cognition) of idealization. Countable [piecewise entities demonstrate](1/1/3/2/_Countable-Uncountable) [the ability to](3/1/3/3/1/1/2/2/.Skills) [fragment reality into](2/1/2/3/1/3/.Realism) countable units, opening [it up for](3/1/3/3/2/3/1/.Price) numerical manipulation. Conversely, [uncountability encapsulates notions](1/1/3/2/_Countable-Uncountable) [that inherently escape](1/2/3/3/2/3/2/.Escape%20Velocity) arithmetized quantification, like the continuum. This duality, as it [appears in mathematics](2/3/2/3/1/1/.Mathematics) and philosophy, reflects [the dialectical tension](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) [between discrete fragmentation](1/1/3/1/2/2/2/.Fragmentation) and undivided continuity, [between the tangible](1/1/3/1/1/2/1/.Tangible) and the intangible.
