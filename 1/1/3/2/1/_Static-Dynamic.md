The antinomic mutual relation between the changeless (static) and motion (dynamic) encapsulates the interplay between stability and change. While the changeless provides consistency, stability, and predictability, motion ensures transformation, evolution, and progress. These concepts are complementary rather than opposing, with processes fluctuating between periods of stability and periods of change. The relationship between static and dynamic is a timeless dance, embodying the tension between the need for security and the drive for change.
