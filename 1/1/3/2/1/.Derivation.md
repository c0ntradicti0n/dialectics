[Derivation is an](1/1/3/2/1/.Derivation) [essential element of](3/1/3/3/1/2/1/2/_Essential-Nonessential) formal system, serving [as a process](3/1/1/2/2/2/1/1/1/2/2/1/.Process) [of deducing specific](2/2/2/2/3/1/.Deductive%20Reasoning) consequences from first principles. From a mathematical standpoint, it performs an integral role as an operator capable of [measuring the degree](1/2/1/2/3/1/1/3/.Degree) of change or [a gradient of](1/1/3/2/3/1/1/.Gradient) a mathematical function. However, this derivative, [arises from a](1/2/2/2/1/3/1/3/.Emergent) [primary original concept](1/1/2/.Primary%20Categories) or entity, thereby [demonstrating its inherent](1/1/2/3/2/2/.Proof) relation to the process of unfoldment [within the dialectical](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) system.
