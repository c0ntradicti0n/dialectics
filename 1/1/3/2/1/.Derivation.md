Derivation is an essential element of formal system, serving as a process of deducing specific consequences from first principles. From a mathematical standpoint, it performs an integral role as an operator capable of measuring the degree of change or a gradient of a mathematical function. However, this derivative, arises from a primary original concept or entity, thereby demonstrating its inherent relation to the process of unfoldment within the dialectical system.
