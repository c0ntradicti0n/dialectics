In contrast to the changeless, motion signifies the dynamic facet of existence, emphasizing the continuous process of change, transformation, and evolution. Motion encapsulates various types of changes, both physical and abstract - displacement, growth, decay, and progress. It represents change in terms of space, time, and matter. It's a crucial concept that underpins many branches of science, ranging from physics to biology to psychology. As Isaac Newton stated in his first law of motion, "Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external force acts on it."
