In contrast to the changeless, motion [signifies the dynamic](1/1/3/2/1/_Static-Dynamic) facet of existence, emphasizing the continuous process of change, transformation, and evolution. [Motion encapsulates various](1/1/3/2/1/2/.Motion) types of changes, both physical and abstract - displacement, growth, decay, and progress. It represents [change in terms](2/2/3/2/3/3/.Change%20and%20Permanence) of space, time, and matter. It's [a crucial concept](1/1/2/3/2/3/.Theorem) that underpins many branches of science, [ranging from physics](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) to biology to psychology. As Isaac [Newton stated in](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Newtonian%20Mechanics) [his first law](3/2/2/3/1/3/.Supranational%20Law) of motion, "Every object in a state of uniform [motion will remain](3/2/1/2/2/1/1/_Still-Motion) in that state [of motion unless](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) [an external force](1/2/1/2/3/2/2/1/.Force) acts on it."
