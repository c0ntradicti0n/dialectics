Progression embodies the notion of directed change. Unlike mere motion, which can be aimless or oscillatory, progression infers a positive, often linear movement towards a specified end. In essence, progression encapsulates the concept of advancement, growth or evolution towards a definite goal. This could relate to a progression in knowledge, technological development, societal advances, or personal growth. It's a central feature of both human history and individual life narratives. As Martin Luther King Jr. profoundly noted, "If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward." you do you have to keep moving forward." you do you have to keep moving forward." you do you have to keep moving forward." you do you have to keep moving forward." you do you have to keep moving forward." you do you have to keep moving forward." you do you have to keep moving forward."
