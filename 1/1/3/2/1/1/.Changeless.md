[The concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) [the changeless refers](1/1/3/2/1/1/.Changeless) to entities that [retain their intrinsic](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) characteristics over time, unaffected by external and internal variables. Such entities or systems establish themselves [as constants amidst](1/1/3/2/1/2/2/3/.Constant) [the ever-evolving landscape](3/3/2/1/2/3/.Landscape%20Architecture) of existence. They serve as grounded foundations, fundamental principles, [or universal constants](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/2/2/.Effect%20of%20Constants) in various disciplines. [From mathematical postulates](1/1/2/3/2/3/.Theorem) to natural laws, [the changeless forms](1/1/3/2/1/1/.Changeless) the cornerstone of our understanding and predictions of the future. As the [Greek philosopher Heraclitus](3/3/1/2/2/1/.Greek%20Pantheon) once said, "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.
