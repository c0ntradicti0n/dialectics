The concept of the changeless refers to entities that retain their intrinsic characteristics over time, unaffected by external and internal variables. Such entities or systems establish themselves as constants amidst the ever-evolving landscape of existence. They serve as grounded foundations, fundamental principles, or universal constants in various disciplines. From mathematical postulates to natural laws, the changeless forms the cornerstone of our understanding and predictions of the future. As the Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said, "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.
