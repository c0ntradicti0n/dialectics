Wholeness refers to the complete and unified totality of a system or entity, understood as an integrated whole rather than merely a collection of parts. This concept can be thought of as a thesis that asserts the primacy of the collective whole over individual components. In its purest form, it embodies a holistic approach that seeks to understand phenomena in terms of their entirety and interconnectedness. From this perspective, every part contributes to the composition and function of the whole, thus, any change in a single part inevitably influences the entire system. However, this holistic perspective lacks the granular insight that comes with examining individual components, leading to the antithesis, algebra.
