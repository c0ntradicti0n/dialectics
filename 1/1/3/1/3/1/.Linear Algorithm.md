[A linear algorithm](1/1/3/2/2/1/.Algorithms) [follows a sequential](1/1/3/1/3/1/1/.Sequential) procedure, solving problems through a consistent progression of steps performed one after another. This algorithmic pattern, perceptible in assembly lines, reading a book, or computer programming, underscores predictability, simplicity, and efficiency, though it may largely be [time-consuming for problems](1/1/3/1/3/3/.Heuristic%20Algorithm) that escalate in complexity.
