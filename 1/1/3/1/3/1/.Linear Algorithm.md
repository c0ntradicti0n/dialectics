A linear algorithm follows a sequential procedure, solving problems through a consistent progression of steps performed one after another. This algorithmic pattern, perceptible in assembly lines, reading a book, or computer programming, underscores predictability, simplicity, and efficiency, though it may largely be time-consuming for problems that escalate in complexity.
