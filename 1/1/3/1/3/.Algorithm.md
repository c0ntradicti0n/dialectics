[Synthesizing discrete and](1/1/3/1/3/.Algorithm) infinity, an Algorithm [mediates between individual](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/.Communication) [steps(inputs/discrete) and the](1/1/3/1/3/.Algorithm) [indefinite continuation of](1/2/2/2/2/_Expansion-Stagnation) those steps (Infinity). It is a set of rules [or processes inscribed](3/3/3/3/3/1/1/2/_Erosion-Settlement) [into a systematic](1/1/3/1/1/2/2/2/.Abstract) order of thinking, moving, and creating.
