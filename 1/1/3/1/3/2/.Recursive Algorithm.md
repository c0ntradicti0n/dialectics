[Recursive algorithms solve](1/1/3/1/3/2/.Recursive%20Algorithm) [complex problems by](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/3/3/3/.Complex%20Plane) subdividing them into simpler or smaller instances, employing the [same solution model](2/3/1/3/3/3/.Model%20Validity) recursively. It pivots on a base case, serving as an exit point, and a set [of self-referential diversion](1/1/3/1/3/2/2/.Self-Reference) [cases that split](1/1/3/2/3/1/_Separation-Union) the problem recursively. As a potent problem-solving strategy, recursion manifests in natural phenomena, fractals, and computer science.
