Recursive algorithms solve complex problems by subdividing them into simpler or smaller instances, employing the same solution model recursively. It pivots on a base case, serving as an exit point, and a set of self-referential diversion cases that split the problem recursively. As a potent problem-solving strategy, recursion manifests in natural phenomena, fractals, and computer science.
