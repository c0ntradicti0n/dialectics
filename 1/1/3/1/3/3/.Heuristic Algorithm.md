[Heuristic algorithms provide](1/1/3/1/3/3/.Heuristic%20Algorithm) practical, effective yet [not necessarily optimal](1/1/3/1/3/3/3/.Optimization) [solutions for complex](1/2/1/3/1/3/2/2/3/.Complex%20Constant) problems. They identify [potential solutions based](1/1/3/2/3/3/2/2/3/.General%20Solutions) on experiential learning, rules of thumb, intuition, or educated guesses when an ideal or exhaustive solution is unfeasible. [Heuristics are employed](1/1/3/1/3/3/.Heuristic%20Algorithm) in various fields, [from artificial intelligence](2/3/3/3/2/3/.Artificial%20Intelligence) and optimization to [cognitive psychology and](2/1/3/3/1/3/.Cognitive) decision-making processes.
