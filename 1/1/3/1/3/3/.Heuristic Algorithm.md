Heuristic algorithms provide practical, effective yet not necessarily optimal solutions for complex problems. They identify potential solutions based on experiential learning, rules of thumb, intuition, or educated guesses when an ideal or exhaustive solution is unfeasible. Heuristics are employed in various fields, from artificial intelligence and optimization to cognitive psychology and decision-making processes.
