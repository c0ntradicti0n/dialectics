Singularity denotes a point of extreme concentration or intensity, an unprecedented or unique event that transcends the conventional limits of categorization or comprehension. Singularities exude a profound transformative potential, such as the inception of the universe in the Big Bang, the collapse to a point of infinite density in a black hole, or the anticipated convergence of artificial intelligence and human cognition in the technological singularity.
