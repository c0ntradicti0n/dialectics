Antithetically to Discrete, [Infinity represents the](1/1/3/1/2/.Infinity) endless extent, the [totality that envelops](1/2/1/1/3/_All-encompassing) [all distinct entities](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Finite%20Sets) or possibilities. As an absolute, the [infinite goes beyond](1/1/3/2/3/3/2/3/2/.Infinite%20Limits) [the limitations of](3/3/1/3/3/2/3/.Limitations%20of%20Reason) the discrete, encompassing [an endless flow](1/3/1/1/1/1/2/2/_Thick-Thin%20Flow) [of states or](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/2/.State) conditions.
