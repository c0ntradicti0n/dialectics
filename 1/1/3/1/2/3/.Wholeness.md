[Wholeness corresponds to](1/1/3/1/2/3/.Wholeness) [the unification of](1/2/1/1/3/2/2/3/.Unification) disparate constituents into a cohesive, complete entirety. It signifies harmony, integrity, and [a sense of](2/1/3/1/3/.Feeling) [completeness derived through](1/1/3/1/2/3/1/.Completeness) the integration of [diverse elements or](3/2/3/3/2/3/3/_Diversity-Unity) facets, vividly illustrated in the trope of a jigsaw puzzle, an ecological system, or a symphony. Wholeness exhorts an elevated perspective, [transcending the minutiae](1/1/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) to appreciate the [beauty and coherence](2/2/2/1/3/3/3/3/.Mathematical%20Coherence) of the larger pattern.

[_quote_ "The whole](1/2/1/1/3/3/3/3/.Whole) is greater than the sum of its parts." - Aristotle
