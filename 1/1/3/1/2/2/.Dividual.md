The concept of dividual challenges the sacrosanct notion of individuality, positing an entity as a conglomeration of independent, divisible segments, fragments, or aspects. Dividuals can be discerned in sociocultural constructs where identity merges and flows within communal, networked structures, highlighting our inherent multiplicity, paradox, and dynamism.
