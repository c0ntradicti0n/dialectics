Counting, at its core, is a [longitudinal mapping of](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/1/3/.Refractory%20Period) [structure onto an](1/1/3/3/1/2/2/.Structure) [undifferentiated succession of](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/2/.Succession) units. The dimensions [of counting expand](1/1/3/1/.Dimensions%20of%20Counting) this process, extending [linear measurements into](2/3/1/2/3/.Measurement) [the unbounded realms](1/1/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) [of the two-dimensional](1/2/1/3/1/2/.Spatial%20Dimensions) plane, three-dimensional space, and beyond. Each [additional dimension imbues](1/2/1/3/1/2/.Spatial%20Dimensions) [the counting process](1/1/3/3/.Combinatorics) [with added complexity](1/2/2/2/2/1/1/3/.Complexity) and richness, transforming [numbers into geometric](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/3/2/1/.Rational%20Numbers) forms, topological structures, and multidimensional entities.
