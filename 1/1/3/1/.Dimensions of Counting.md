Counting, at its core, is a longitudinal mapping of structure onto an undifferentiated succession of units. The dimensions of counting expand this process, extending linear measurements into the unbounded realms of the two-dimensional plane, three-dimensional space, and beyond. Each additional dimension imbues the counting process with added complexity and richness, transforming numbers into geometric forms, topological structures, and multidimensional entities.
