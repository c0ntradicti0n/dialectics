Quantity delves into the notion of measurable attributes inherent to entities. These attributes define the magnitude, amount, size, or number related to a subject or entity. The notion of quantity transcends the mere numeral attributes, extending into the foundational aspects of reality: from the infinitesimal to the boundlessly vast, from the discrete individual units to the continuous expanses. It is the domain that bridges the gap between the abstract numerical world and tangible existence, ensuring the conceptual understanding of the universe's physical essence.
