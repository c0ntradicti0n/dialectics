Boundaries delineate the finite from the infinite, serving as a limit to the scope of an entity. They separate the 'within' from the 'without' and define the existence of a thing. However, boundaries, while appearing to restrict, also form the foundation for the interplay between the finite and the infinite, leading to the unfolding and development of the entity.
