The number, mathematics, and pattern triptych unfolds as an abstract process that provides us with a comprehension of the concrete world. In this light, the number allows us to abstract entities, mathematics enables us to establish relationships between these abstract entities, and the pattern extracts the inherent rules within these relationships. This process of "abstraction of the concrete" allows us to transcend the individual distinctiveness of each entity and perceive the interconnected, relational and rule-based structure of the world.
