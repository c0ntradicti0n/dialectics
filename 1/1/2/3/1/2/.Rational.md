Rational numbers, as [the ratio of](1/1/3/2/3/1/3/3/.Ratio) two integers, infuse [granularity into the](1/1/3/2/1/1/3/3/.Regularity) [starkly discrete world](1/1/3/1/1/.Discrete) of integers. They [constitute a superset](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/1/_Subset-Superset) [of integers while](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/2/3/.Integers) [blurring the brittle](3/1/1/2/3/3/3/_Blur-Clarity) [delineation by introducing](1/1/2/3/2/_Induction-Deduction) [fractions and decimal](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/3/2/3/.Decimal%20Expansion) values. With every rational number, we [grasp a finer](1/2/3/1/3/2/1/2/_Grip-Loosen) detail of the world, transitioning from [the 'either-or' realm](1/1/2/3/1/2/.Rational) [towards the liberating](2/3/2/2/_Oppression-Liberation) domain of 'in-betweenness'. Yet, the spectrum [of rationality is](2/1/3/2/1/_Rational-Intuitive) still bound by countability, falling short when it comes to translating the [seamless continuity of](1/2/1/1/1/3/1/2/.Continuity) reality.
