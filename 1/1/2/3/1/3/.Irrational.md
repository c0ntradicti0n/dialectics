Irrational numbers, resolute [in their defiance](2/2/1/1/1/2/.Courage) [of being expressed](3/3/2/3/2/1/2/.Emotion%20Expression) [as a ratio](1/1/3/2/3/1/3/3/.Ratio) of two integers, allow the plunge [into the infinite](1/2/1/1/1/2/3/2/.Line%20at%20Infinity) [depths of numerical](1/2/1/1/3/1/3/_Surface-Depth) continuity. They bring [to life the](3/3/3/1/3/3/.Breath%20of%20Life) transcendence of numbers, [embodying the boundlessness](1/1/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) [of reality by](3/3/3/2/3/2/.The%20Song%20of%20Roland) encapsulating the case where being does not coincide with quantification. However, their unending, non-repeating decimal [representations underscore the](1/1/3/1/1/2/3/.Representational) [ungraspability of infinity](1/2/1/1/3/3/2/3/.Unbounded) [that defies complete](1/2/1/2/1/1/3/2/.Complete) description.
