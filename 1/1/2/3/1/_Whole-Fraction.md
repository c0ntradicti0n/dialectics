The progression from whole numbers (integers) to fractions (rational and irrational numbers) reflects the dialectical unfolding from discreteness towards continuity. Integers, robust in their uniqueness, pave the way for rational numbers that add granularity. Finally, irrational numbers leap into the infinity of continuity that defies discretization. They incorporate the 'either-or' and the 'in-betweenness', striving to mirror the infinite complexity of reality in numerical abstraction.
