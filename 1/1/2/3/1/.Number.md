[A Number is](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) [the elementary quantified](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) entity, that serves as the foundation [for quantifying the](1/2/1/2/3/1/3/.Measurement) world around us. [Whether to count](1/2/1/3/1/3/3/2/3/.Count) [apples or measure](1/2/1/2/3/1/3/.Measurement) length, we need numbers. By assigning [a number to](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) a cluster of oranges, or the [length of a](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/1/.Length) table, we become capable to compare oranges to apples, or a table's [length to a](1/2/1/3/1/2/1/1/.Length) door's height. Thus, [these elementary entities](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) enable us to interact with the world in a [meaningful and quantified](2/3/1/2/3/_Qualitative-Quantitative) way.
