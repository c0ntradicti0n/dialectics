[A Number is](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) [the elementary quantified](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) entity, that serves [as the foundation](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) [for quantifying the](2/3/1/2/3/.Measurement) world around us. [Whether to count](1/1/3/1/.Dimensions%20of%20Counting) [apples or measure](2/3/1/2/3/.Measurement) length, we need numbers. By assigning [a number to](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) [a cluster of](1/3/1/2/3/2/2/1/1/.Cluster%20Compounds) oranges, or the [length of a](1/2/3/2/1/3/.Length%20Contraction) table, we become [capable to compare](2/3/1/1/2/2/.Evaluation) oranges to apples, [or a table's](3/2/3/3/3/2/2/.Board%20Rooms) [length to a](1/2/3/2/1/3/.Length%20Contraction) door's height. Thus, [these elementary entities](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) [enable us to](2/2/2/2/3/2/3/.Desire) [interact with the](2/1/1/3/3/.Social%20Interactions) [world in a](3/.Culture) [meaningful and quantified](2/3/1/2/3/_Qualitative-Quantitative) way.
