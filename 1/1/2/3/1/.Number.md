A Number is the elementary quantified entity, that serves as the foundation for quantifying the world around us. Whether to count apples or measure length, we need numbers. By assigning a number to a cluster of oranges, or the length of a table, we become capable to compare oranges to apples, or a table's length to a door's height. Thus, these elementary entities enable us to interact with the world in a meaningful and quantified way.
