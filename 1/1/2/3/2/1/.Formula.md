Formulas are shorthand representations of relationships and patterns within the world of numbers. Providing a syntactic structure to our understanding, they serve as a conduit between the sensible and the intelligible, distilling reality into an array of signs. Yet, every formula implies the presence of an underlying proof, signalling the limit of naked assertions and the need for robust justification.
