[Mathematics is the](2/3/2/3/1/1/.Mathematics) [language in which](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/2/1/.Languages) [the numbers communicate](1/1/2/3/2/.Mathematics) and interact. Through [the invention of](2/3/3/3/1/1/1/1/.Invention) mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, [numbers can dynamically](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/2/3/.Integers) [evolve and transform](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) into new ones. Mathematics, hence, is [not merely a](3/3/2/2/1/2/1/.Protagonist) [tool for numerical](3/1/1/1/3/1/.Measurement%20Tools) computation, but also [serves as the](2/1/1/1/3/3/.Purpose) [interpretational tool for](2/2/3/2/1/3/.Interpretation) [understanding the relationships](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) between different numbers, and by extent, [the relationships between](1/3/1/3/1/3/.Ecological%20Relationships) [different things that](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/.Communication) [are represented by](1/1/3/1/1/2/3/.Representational) [these numbers in](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/2/1/.Natural%20Numbers) the world.
