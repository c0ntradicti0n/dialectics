Mathematics is the language in which the numbers communicate and interact. Through the invention of mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, numbers can dynamically evolve and transform into new ones. Mathematics, hence, is not merely a tool for numerical computation, but also serves as the interpretational tool for understanding the relationships between different numbers, and by extent, the relationships between different things that are represented by these numbers in the world.
