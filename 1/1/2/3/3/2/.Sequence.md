[A sequence is](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/.Sequence) [an ordered array](1/1/2/3/3/3/.Array) of entities, governed [by deterministic rules](2/2/3/1/3/_Determinism-Randomness) or formulas. Each individual element possesses relational attributes, that serve to link it to its [preceding or succeeding](3/1/3/3/1/2/3/2/_Before-During-After) counterpart, establishing a chain or progression. [Sequences can have](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/.Sequence) either finite or [infinite lengths and](1/2/1/1/1/2/3/2/.Line%20at%20Infinity) span across numeric series, genetic code, music notes, or [series of events](1/2/2/3/3/2/.Sequence) in a narrative. They embody an essential aspect of ordered temporality, where every component has a distinct place [within an overarching](3/3/2/2/3/3/.Themes%20and%20Interpretations) order.

_quote_ "In nature, we find not only that one [event follows upon](2/1/3/2/2/1/1/.Event) another, but also that one event presupposes another." - [Immanuel Kant](3/3/1/3/2/1/2/.Sartre's%20Freedom)
