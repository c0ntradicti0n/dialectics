A sequence is an ordered array of entities, governed by deterministic rules or formulas. Each individual element possesses relational attributes, that serve to link it to its preceding or succeeding counterpart, establishing a chain or progression. Sequences can have either finite or infinite lengths and span across numeric series, genetic code, music notes, or series of events in a narrative. They embody an essential aspect of ordered temporality, where every component has a distinct place within an overarching order.
