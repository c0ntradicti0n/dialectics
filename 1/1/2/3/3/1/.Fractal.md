[Fractals are self-replicating](1/1/2/3/3/1/.Fractal) [geometric constructs that](2/3/2/3/2/3/.Geometry) [exhibit perfect invariance](1/1/3/2/1/1/3/.Invariance) across scale. They [exist between the](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) realms of dimensionality, neither fully two nor three-dimensional, thus [inhabiting the abstract](2/1/3/2/_Abstract-Concrete) [world of fractional](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/3/2/1/3/.Fractional%20Powers) dimensions. Through iterative processes, each part of a fractal, no matter how minuscule, reflects the whole with precise fidelity. Fractals can be encountered everywhere, from the spiraling [patterns of a](2/2/2/1/3/3/1/_Pattern-Irregularity) pinecone or fern to the meandering course of a river, underlining a profound interconnectedness between [mathematical functions and](2/3/2/3/1/1/.Mathematics) nature's aesthetics.
