An array is an ordered collection of elements or objects, organized into rows, columns, or higher-dimensional structures. Each element within the array embodies equal importance and is identifiable by its unique address or index, the coordinates that demarcate its location within the matrix. Arrays are omnipresent in computer programming, digital imagery, data storage, and signal processing, providing a procedural framework for manipulating large datasets.
