A Pattern is the recurring structure found within numbers and their operations that indicates some sort of rules, laws, or regularities. Generated through the process of quantifying and the operations of mathematics, patterns reveal information about the behavior of the world, its rules and its predictability. A pattern can be as simple as the recurring "2" in the number series of even numbers, or as complex as the Fibonacci sequence found all throughout nature.
