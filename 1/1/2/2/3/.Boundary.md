Boundary, operating as [a synthesis of](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) contrast and alteration, [demarcates the limit](1/2/1/1/2/3/1/3/.Limit) where the two states coincide, separating and linking them simultaneously. Encapsulating the [‘edge conditions’ manifesting](1/1/2/2/3/.Boundary) [as an entity](1/1/2/3/1/.Number) [transits from one](3/1/3/3/2/1/3/1/.Transport) [state or condition](3/1/3/3/3/2/.State%20Functions) to another.
