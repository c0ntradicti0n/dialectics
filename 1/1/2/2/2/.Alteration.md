Alteration, as the antithesis, describes the [transformative process in](3/3/3/_Manifestation-Transformation) which the state or condition of an entity changes, [challenging the static](1/1/3/2/1/_Static-Dynamic) state highlighted by contrast. Alteration can surface as a perhaps surprising change, [shifting from one](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) state/condition to another, [undermining the initial](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/3/_Initial-Limit) contrast.
