Alteration, as the antithesis, describes the [transformative process in](1/1/2/2/.Change) [which the state](3/2/3/2/2/1/.State%20ownership) [or condition of](2/3/1/1/2/1/.Criteria) an entity changes, [challenging the static](1/3/1/3/2/_Static-Evolution) [state highlighted by](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/2/.State) contrast. Alteration can [surface as a](1/2/1/3/3/3/1/.Surface) perhaps surprising change, [shifting from one](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) state/condition to another, [undermining the initial](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/3/_Initial-Limit) contrast.
