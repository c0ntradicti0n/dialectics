Presence, as a thesis, is the [immediate affirmation of](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/1/.Immediate) [an entity within](1/1/2/3/.Structure) its existing conditions. [It showcases the](3/3/2/1/3/3/.Product%20Aesthetics) [actuality of both](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) [abstract and concrete](1/1/3/2/3/3/3/3/_Abstract-Concrete) forms, arraying the [moment with an](1/2/2/3/2/.Moment) undeniable facticity. Essence is the immediate, [unmediated existence of](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) an entity.
