Presence, as a thesis, is the [immediate affirmation of](1/2/2/2/1/2/1/1/.Immediate) [an entity within](1/2/3/3/2/_Inside-Outside) its existing conditions. It showcases the [actuality of both](2/3/1/3/_Model-Reality) [abstract and concrete](2/1/3/2/_Abstract-Concrete) forms, arraying the [moment with an](1/2/2/3/2/.Moment) undeniable facticity. Essence is the immediate, [unmediated existence of](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) an entity.
