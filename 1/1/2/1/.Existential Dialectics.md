Existential Dialectics refers to the process by which the quality of an entity unfolds through contradiction and negation, affirming its existence in a dynamic interplay with its otherness. The entity is defined as much by what it is as by what it is not, leading to the dialectical concept of the negation of the negation, a double negation that affirms its existence and allows for transformation and progress.
