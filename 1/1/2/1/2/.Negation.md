Negation, as an antithesis, is the [non-existence or absence](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) [of entities or](1/1/3/3/1/3/.Organization) properties, a counterpoint [to the affirmation](2/2/2/3/2/3/.Appeal%20to%20Authority) of presence. The [negation goes beyond](1/1/2/1/2/.Negation) simple non-existence, scripting [the denial of](2/1/1/3/3/3/2/.Denial) the existing state, [or the contradiction](3/3/2/1/2/2/_Irony-Contradiction) [against the thesis](2/2/2/3/1/2/.Denying%20the%20Antecedent) of presence. However, implicit within negation, [is the potential](1/2/2/2/1/3/1/.Potential) for presence, as [absence can only](1/2/1/2/1/_Presence-Absence) [be known against](3/3/3/2/1/1/_Known-Adventure) what is present.
