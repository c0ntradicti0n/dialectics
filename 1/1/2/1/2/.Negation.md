Negation, as an antithesis, is the non-existence or absence of entities or properties, a counterpoint to the affirmation of presence. The negation goes beyond simple non-existence, scripting the denial of the existing state, or the contradiction against the thesis of presence. However, implicit within negation, is the potential for presence, as absence can only be known against what is present.
