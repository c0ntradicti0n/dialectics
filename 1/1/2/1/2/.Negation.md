Negation, as an antithesis, is the [non-existence or absence](1/2/1/2/2/2/_Existence-Absence) [of entities or](3/1/3/3/1/2/2/3/3/_Individual-Collective) properties, a counterpoint [to the affirmation](2/2/2/3/2/3/.Appeal%20to%20Authority) of presence. The [negation goes beyond](1/1/2/1/2/.Negation) simple non-existence, scripting [the denial of](2/1/1/3/3/3/2/.Denial) the existing state, [or the contradiction](3/3/2/1/2/2/_Irony-Contradiction) [against the thesis](2/2/2/3/1/2/.Denying%20the%20Antecedent) of presence. However, implicit within negation, [is the potential](1/2/2/2/1/3/1/.Potential) for presence, as absence can only [be known against](3/3/3/2/1/1/_Known-Adventure) what is present.
