[Primary categories represent](1/1/2/.Primary%20Categories) [the most basic](3/3/2/3/1/1/.Basic%20Positions) [classifications or groupings](1/1/3/3/2/2/1/.Classification) [within any ontological](1/1/1/.Ontology) system. They delineate [the foundational structures](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) [upon which all](1/2/1/1/3/_All-encompassing) [other entities or](3/3/1/2/2/1/2/.Lesser%20Deities) concepts are built, [serving as the](3/3/2/3/2/3/_Performer-Observer) [anchors for understanding](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) the universe. These [categories constitute the](1/1/2/.Primary%20Categories) raw framework, simplifying [the vast diversity](3/3/3/1/_Origin-Diversity) [of existence into](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) [comprehensible and analyzable](3/3/1/3/3/2/_Unknowable-Incomprehensible) units. Engaging with [primary categories means](1/1/2/.Primary%20Categories) [delving into the](3/3/2/2/3/3/.Themes%20and%20Interpretations) [intrinsic distinctions that](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) [exist in the](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) realm of being, [tracing the lines](1/2/1/2/1/3/3/2/.Line) [that separate one](1/1/3/2/3/1/_Separation-Union) [fundamental concept from](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/3/.Fundamental) another.
