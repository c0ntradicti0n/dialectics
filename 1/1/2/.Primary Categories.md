They delineate [the foundational structures](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) upon which all other entities or concepts are built, serving as the [anchors for understanding](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) the universe. These [categories constitute the](1/1/2/.Primary%20Categories) raw framework, simplifying the vast diversity of existence into [comprehensible and analyzable](3/3/1/3/3/2/_Unknowable-Incomprehensible) units. Engaging with [primary categories means](1/1/2/.Primary%20Categories) delving into the [intrinsic distinctions that](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) exist in the realm of being, tracing the lines that separate one [fundamental concept from](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/3/.Fundamental) another.
