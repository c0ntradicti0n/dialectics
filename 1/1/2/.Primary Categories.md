Primary categories represent the most basic classifications or groupings within any ontological system. They delineate the foundational structures upon which all other entities or concepts are built, serving as the anchors for understanding the universe. These categories constitute the raw framework, simplifying the vast diversity of existence into comprehensible and analyzable units. Engaging with primary categories means delving into the intrinsic distinctions that exist in the realm of being, tracing the lines that separate one fundamental concept from another.
