Quality, as an inherent or distinctive characteristic, attributes a certain nature to beings, thereby differentiating them. However, the determination of a quality implies the negation of other possible qualities, leading to a cycle of affirmation and negation. As change occurs, a thing transcends its initial boundaries, resulting in an interaction between the finite and the infinite, where the infinite negates and transcends the finite, further evolving the quality.
