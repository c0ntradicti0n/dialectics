The concept of limit is a scaffold on which we construct our understandings of existence, change, and structure. Transcending the concept of limits reveals new layers of comprehension. This transcendence is neither so much absolute as it is an extension, pushing against the finite and blurring the boundary between the quantifiable and the infinitesimal, expanding our comprehension of the world.
