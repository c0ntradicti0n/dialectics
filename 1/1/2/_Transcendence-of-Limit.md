[The concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) [limit is a](1/2/1/1/2/3/1/3/.Limit) scaffold on which we construct our understandings of existence, change, and structure. [Transcending the concept](1/1/2/_Transcendence-of-Limit) [of limits reveals](1/2/1/1/2/3/1/3/.Limit) [new layers of](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/3/2/.Layered) comprehension. This transcendence is neither so much absolute as it is an extension, pushing against [the finite and](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/_Finite-Infinite) [blurring the boundary](1/1/2/2/3/.Boundary) [between the quantifiable](2/3/1/3/3/1/.Verification%20Principles) and the infinitesimal, [expanding our comprehension](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) of the world.
