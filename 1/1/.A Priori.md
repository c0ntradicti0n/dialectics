A priori, a term derived from Latin, refers to knowledge that comes from the use of reason alone, independent of sensory experience or empirical evidence. It encompasses the principles, such as mathematical truths, logical axioms, or philosophical postulates, that are universally accepted due to their innate nature of being logically undeniable. A priori, as the thesis, emphasizes the role of innate understanding and logical necessity in constituting knowledge.
