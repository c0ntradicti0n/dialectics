The concept of synthetic a priori refers to knowledge that is both synthetic (dependent on experience) and a priori (independent of experience). It represents the idea that certain truths can be known prior to any experience and yet still involve the combination of concepts. This concept challenges the traditional dichotomy between analytic and synthetic judgments and suggests that there are truths about the world that can be known through reason and logical deduction. Synthetic a priori knowledge allows for the expansion of our understanding beyond empirical observations, enabling us to grasp concepts that go beyond immediate sensory perception.
