A priori knowledge refers to knowledge that is independent of experience. It is derived through reason, logic, and deduction rather than through observation or empirical evidence. A priori knowledge is based on innate ideas and concepts that are considered universal and necessary truths. It allows us to make claims about the nature of reality and the principles that govern it without relying on sensory perception. This form of knowledge is non-empirical, meaning it does not require sensory experience to validate its truth.
