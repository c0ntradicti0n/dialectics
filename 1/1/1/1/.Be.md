Existence is the fundamental ontological concept that refers to the state of being, the existence of something in reality. It encompasses the idea that objects or entities have a distinctive being and occupy a specific space and time. Existence is the foundation upon which all other ontological concepts are built, as it pertains to the very essence of the things that exist.
