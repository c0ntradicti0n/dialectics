Existence is a fundamental concept that encompasses the being or reality of things. It refers to the state of having objective existence and being perceptible or observable in the world. Existence implies a distinct and independent presence, separate from our subjective experiences or perceptions. The concept of existence is crucial in understanding objectivity, as it establishes the foundation for the study and analysis of phenomena and the formulation of objective knowledge.
