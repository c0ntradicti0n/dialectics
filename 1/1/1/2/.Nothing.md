Nothing refers to the absence or non-existence of something. In existential terms, nothing is the counterpart to existence. While it may seem contradictory, the concept of nothing is essential in metaphysics because it highlights the relationship between being and non-being. Nothing is not simply the absence of something but has its own semantic existence, being distinct from existence while interconnected with it in a dialectical process.
