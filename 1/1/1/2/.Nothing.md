Nothing, in contrast to existence, represents the absence or lack of being. It is the negation of existence and denotes the state of non-existence. Although it seems opposed to existence, nothing and existence are interconnected in a dialectical relationship. The concept of nothing arises as the antithesis to existence, emphasizing the absence of being.
