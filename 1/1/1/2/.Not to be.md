It is the [negation of existence](1/1/2/1/2/.Negation) and denotes the state of non-existence. Although it seems opposed to existence, [nothing and existence](1/1/1/2/.Nothing) are interconnected in a dialectical relationship. [The concept of](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) [nothing arises as](1/1/1/_Vanishing-of-vanishing) [the antithesis to](1/1/2/1/2/.Negation) existence, emphasizing the absence of being.
