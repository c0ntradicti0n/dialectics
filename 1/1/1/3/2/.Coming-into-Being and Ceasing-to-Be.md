[Coming into Being](1/1/1/3/2/.Coming-into-Being%20and%20Ceasing-to-Be) [is the transformation](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) [from Nothing into](1/1/1/3/2/.Coming-into-Being%20and%20Ceasing-to-Be) Being; it signifies [the manifestation of](3/1/1/2/2/_Manifestation-Interpretation) existence. Conversely, Ceasing-to-Be [is Being's transition](1/1/1/3/1/.Transition) into Nothing; the [dissolution or disintegration](1/3/1/2/3/1/2/1/1/.Dissociation) of existence. These [processes embody the](1/2/3/3/2/_Inside-Outside) [dialectics of becoming](1/1/1/3/.Becoming) and vanishing. They [depict how existence](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) is a seamless fluid flow of dual states, always in the act of transitioning. As Jiddu Krishnamurti said, ["To live is](3/3/1/3/2/2/_Life-Purposelessness) [to be slowly](1/2/3/1/3/1/2/.Gradual) born."
