Coming into Being is the transformation from Nothing into Being; it signifies the manifestation of existence. Conversely, Ceasing-to-Be is Being's transition into Nothing; the dissolution or disintegration of existence. These processes embody the dialectics of becoming and vanishing. They depict how existence is a seamless fluid flow of dual states, always in the act of transitioning. As Jiddu Krishnamurti said, "To live is to be slowly born."
