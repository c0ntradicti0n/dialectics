Becoming is the synthesis that emerges from the interplay between existence and nothingness. It captures the dynamic and fluid nature of reality, in which entities constantly transition between states of being and non-being. Becoming signifies the process of transformation, the continuous movement and change that characterizes the unfolding of existence. It encapsulates the notion that the world is in a perpetual state of flux, with entities undergoing constant becoming.
