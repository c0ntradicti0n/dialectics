Becoming, the unseparated unity of being and nothing, encapsulates these states as vanishing moments, constantly in flux, expressing itself through two key movements: coming-to-be, where nothing transitions to being, and ceasing-to-be, where being transitions to nothing. This continuous interplay leads to a self-sublation within each state, causing the "vanishing of the vanishing itself", settling into a stable unity that encapsulates the vanished becoming, which is determinate being, a unity of being and nothing in the form of being.
