Becoming encompasses the dynamic process of transition and transformation between existence and nothing. It represents the continuous flux and interplay between being and non-being, as properties emerge, disappear, and transform. Becoming captures the essence of change and development in the objective realm, where things evolve and acquire new properties over time. It is through the concept of becoming that we can grasp the fluidity and interconnectedness of the objective world, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of reality.
