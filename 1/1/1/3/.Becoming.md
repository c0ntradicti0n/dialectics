Becoming encompasses the continuous transition between being and nothing. It involves the constant interplay and transformation of entities as they move from one state to another. Becoming encapsulates the process of coming-to-be, where something evolves from nothing into being, as well as the process of ceasing-to-be, where something transitions from being to nothing. This dynamic movement within becoming leads to a self-sublation, resulting in a stable unity that integrates the vanished becoming.
