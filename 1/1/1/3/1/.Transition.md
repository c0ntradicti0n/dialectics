Transition, within the context of Becoming, [signifies the movement](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/.Movement) from the states of Nothing and Being. This transitional shift indicates the [dynamic nature of](1/1/3/2/1/_Static-Dynamic) [existence - a](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) [constant flux between](1/1/3/2/1/1/_Static-Flux) [the polarities of](1/3/1/2/2/2/1/.Polarity) being and non-being. This state of [continuous transition encapsulates](1/2/1/1/1/3/2/2/.Transition%20Maps) [the essence of](2/2/3/2/3/_Essence-Appearance) becoming, a process that fundamentally unites [the antithetical states](1/2/1/2/2/_Matter-Antimatter) of nothing and being. George Eliot astutely observed: "Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love."
