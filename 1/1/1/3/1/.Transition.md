Transition, within the context of Becoming, signifies the movement from the states of Nothing and Being. This transitional shift indicates the dynamic nature of existence - a constant flux between the polarities of being and non-being. This state of continuous transition encapsulates the essence of becoming, a process that fundamentally unites the antithetical states of nothing and being. George Eliot astutely observed: "Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love."
