The antinomic relationship between sameness-different captures the dialectical tension within the process of becoming. The dynamic states of being and nothing are fundamentally the same yet also antithetical. Their sameness lies in their undifferentiated immediacy, while their difference manifests in their transient movements, vanishing into each other in the flow of becoming.
