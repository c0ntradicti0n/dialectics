[The antinomic relationship](2/2/2/1/_Organic-Inorganic) [between sameness-different captures](1/1/1/3/_Sameness-Different) [the dialectical tension](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) within the process of becoming. The [dynamic states of](3/1/3/3/3/2/.State%20Functions) [being and nothing](1/2/1/2/2/1/3/_Being-Nonbeing) [are fundamentally the](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/3/.Fundamental) same yet also antithetical. Their sameness lies in their undifferentiated immediacy, while [their difference manifests](1/1/1/3/_Sameness-Different) [in their transient](3/1/1/2/_Transient-Enduring) movements, vanishing into each other in [the flow of](1/3/1/1/1/1/1/2/3/2/_Thick-Thin%20Flow) becoming.
