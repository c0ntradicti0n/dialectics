[Sublation represents a](1/3/1/2/3/3/1/3/2/.Substitution) [transformative layer of](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) dialectical motion, where previous states are not merely suppressed or consumed; rather, they are elevated [and preserved within](2/2/1/3/2/1/.Preservation) the resulting synthesis. Through sublation, the [vanished being and](1/1/1/_Vanishing-of-vanishing) nothing are conserved, [mediating their antithetical](2/1/2/3/_Positive-Negative) tension within the [stabilizing unity that](1/1/3/2/1/1/1/2/.Stability) is determinate being. [This dialectical process](2/1/2/3/_Positive-Negative) [underscores Hegel's idea](.System) [that "everything flows](2/1/1/2/3/.Fluidity) and nothing stays."
