Sublation represents a transformative layer of dialectical motion, where previous states are not merely suppressed or consumed; rather, they are elevated and preserved within the resulting synthesis. Through sublation, the vanished being and nothing are conserved, mediating their antithetical tension within the stabilizing unity that is determinate being. This dialectical process underscores Hegel's idea that "everything flows and nothing stays."
