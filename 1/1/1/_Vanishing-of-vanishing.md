The vanishing-of-vanishing refers to the self-sublation or negation of the negation that occurs within the synthesis of becoming. It signifies the resolution of the conflict between existence and nothingness, resulting in a new and higher level of understanding. The vanishing-of-vanishing represents the inherent nature of becoming, where the transient moments of existence and non-existence vanish into each other, giving rise to a holistic perspective that encompasses both.
