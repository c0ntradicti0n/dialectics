The concept of 'disappearance-of-disappearing' captures the idea of the transitory nature of becoming, wherein the very act of disappearing (the transitioning from being to nothing) also disappears. This infers that the distinction between being and nothing vanishes in the process of becoming, thus the disappearing itself disappears. Consequently, a new stable state of existence is reached, which simultaneously includes and transcends the initial contradictions.
