The vanishing-of-vanishing is a concept that arises from the dialectical relationship between things and properties. As properties define and distinguish things, there is a constant interplay between the existence of properties and the disappearance of their absence. When a property is identified or defined, its absence vanishes, giving birth to a new state of existence. This vanishing-of-vanishing captures the dynamic nature of objectivity, as properties continually emerge and disappear, shaping our understanding of the world.
