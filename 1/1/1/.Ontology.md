The relationship between things and properties is a fundamental aspect of objectivity. Things refer to individual entities or objects that exist independently, while properties are the characteristics or attributes that define and describe those things. Things can possess multiple properties simultaneously, and these properties are perceived and understood through observation and analysis. The study of things and properties forms the basis of empirical investigation and scientific inquiry, as it allows us to categorize and make sense of the world around us.
