[Ontology concerns the](1/1/1/.Ontology) study of being, [probing into the](3/2/1/1/1/.Investigating) [nature and categorization](1/1/3/3/2/2/2/.Categorization) of entities. Central to philosophical metaphysics, [ontology grapples with](1/1/1/.Ontology) [questions pertaining to](1/2/1/2/2/1/3/2/.Metaphysical%20Queries) what types of [entities exist or](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) can be said to exist, and [how such entities](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) might be grouped, related within a hierarchy, or subdivided in accordance with similarities and differences. The very core [of ontology is](1/1/1/.Ontology) [the exploration of](1/2/1/1/2/3/3/.Exploration) [the nature of](1/2/1/1/1/2/3/3/.Dual%20Nature) [existence and its](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) fundamental categories.
