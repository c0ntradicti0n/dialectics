Ontology, as the philosophical study of being in its most general sense, strives to comprehend the fundamental structures and principles of reality. In its simplest form, it investigates the nature and relations of beings that constitute reality. However, ontology, in its pursuit of 'what is,' lacks a definitive anchor of reality, oscillating between the absolutes of pure being and pure nothing. Its dynamic nature, akin to the Hegelian concept of becoming, leads to an evolution of understanding from the indeterminate to the determinate.
