Ontology deals with the study of existence and the nature of being. It seeks to understand the fundamental categories of things and their properties. In this context, things refer to objects or entities that have a distinct existence. Properties, on the other hand, are the attributes or characteristics that define and differentiate these things. Ontology explores questions such as what it means for something to exist, how things are related to one another, and the nature of their properties.
