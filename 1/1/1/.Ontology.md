Ontology is the branch of metaphysics that explores the nature of existence and being. It investigates the fundamental and universal aspects of things and their properties. Ontology seeks to answer questions such as: What is the nature of reality? What are the basic building blocks of existence? It delves into the study of entities, their properties, and the relationships between them.
