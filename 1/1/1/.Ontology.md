Ontology is the branch of metaphysics concerned with the study of existence and being. It explores fundamental questions about the nature of reality, such as what it means to exist and how entities relate to one another. Ontology delves into the essence and properties of being, aiming to understand the fundamental categories of existence and the ways in which they manifest in the world.
