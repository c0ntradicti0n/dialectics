Ontology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being and reality. It explores the fundamental questions about existence, substance, and the categories of being. Ontology seeks to understand what it means for something to exist and what properties or attributes objects possess. It encompasses the study of both physical and non-physical entities and aims to uncover the nature of reality itself.
