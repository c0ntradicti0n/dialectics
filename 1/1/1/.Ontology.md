**Thesis:** Ontology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the study of existence and the nature of being. It explores questions about what exists, how things exist, and the fundamental characteristics of reality. Ontology seeks to understand the ultimate nature of reality and the different types of entities that exist.

**Antithesis:** However, ontology is not just concerned with the study of being. It also delves into the study of nothingness and non-being. While being and nothingness may seem contradictory, they are interconnected and inseparable. The absence of being, or nothingness, plays a significant role in shaping the nature of existence and gives context to the concept of being.

**Synthesis:** The synthesis of being and nothingness is found in the concept of becoming. Becoming represents the constant interplay and transition between being and non-being. It is through this process of becoming that entities come into existence and cease to exist. Becoming encapsulates both being and nothingness, reflecting the dynamic and fluid nature of reality.

**Antinomic Mutual Relation:** The antinomic mutual relation within the synthesis of becoming is the "vanishing of the vanishing itself." This refers to the idea that becoming involves the simultaneous vanishing of both being and nothingness, resulting in the emergence of new forms of existence. The vanishing of the vanishing signifies the inherent transformation and evolution of reality, as one state gives way to another.
