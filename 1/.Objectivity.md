Objectivity refers to the state or quality of being independent of individual perspectives, opinions, or biases. It represents the external reality that exists regardless of our subjective experiences or interpretations. Objectivity seeks to establish facts and truths based on evidence and rationality rather than personal feelings or beliefs.
