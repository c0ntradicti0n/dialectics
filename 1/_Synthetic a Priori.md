[Synthetic a priori](1/_Synthetic%20a%20Priori) [propositions are those](3/3/1/3/3/2/3/.Limitations%20of%20Reason) that are independent [of experience (a](1/1/3/2/2/1/3/3/.Experience-based) [priori) but are](2/1/3/3/1/3/3/.Presumption) [not derived solely](1/1/3/2/1/.Derivation) from the definition of terms (synthetic). [These statements provide](1/2/1/2/2/3/3/.Practical%20Implications) essential knowledge about the world that is both necessary and non-empirical. For example, mathematical truths [and certain fundamental](1/1/3/1/1/1/1/3/.Fundamental) [principles in physics](2/3/2/3/1/2/.Physics) may be considered synthetic a priori. [They are foundational](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) for constructing a [coherent understanding of](2/1/3/3/2/2/.Understanding) reality, bridging pure [logic with empirical](3/3/1/3/1/1/1/.Empirical%20Data) observations.

[The interrelation of](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) [synthetic a priori](1/_Synthetic%20a%20Priori) [knowledge lies in](2/2/3/3/3/2/.Knowledge) its unique position [between purely empirical](3/3/1/3/1/1/1/.Empirical%20Data) knowledge, which is derived from experience, and non-empirical knowledge, which stands irrespective of it. This pivot amplifies the evolution of argumentation, [revealing how foundational](2/1/1/3/2/1/1/.Foundations) [truths interact with](2/2/3/.Truth) the observable world.
