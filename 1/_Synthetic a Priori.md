Synthetic a priori knowledge refers to propositions or judgments that are both informative and possess necessary truth, independent of empirical observations or experiences. These types of knowledge claims go beyond what is immediately evident or derived from sense perception. They involve the understanding and application of concepts and principles that are not derived from experience but are still considered to be objectively true. Synthetic a priori knowledge plays a central role in fields such as mathematics, logic, and certain areas of philosophy.
