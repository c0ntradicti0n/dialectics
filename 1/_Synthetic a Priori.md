Synthetic a priori propositions are those that are independent of experience (a priori) but are not derived solely from the definition of terms (synthetic). These statements provide essential knowledge about the world that is both necessary and non-empirical. For example, mathematical truths and certain fundamental principles in physics may be considered synthetic a priori. They are foundational for constructing a coherent understanding of reality, bridging pure logic with empirical observations.

The interrelation of synthetic a priori knowledge lies in its unique position between purely empirical knowledge, which is derived from experience, and non-empirical knowledge, which stands irrespective of it. This pivot amplifies the evolution of argumentation, revealing how foundational truths interact with the observable world.
