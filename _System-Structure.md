The system-structure signifies the complex interplay of parts within a larger unity. In the context of our dialectical investigation, it emphasizes the dynamic relationships between metaphysics, anthropology, and the world. The system-structure acts as the dialectical antonym, the pivot around which the conversation evolves. By identifying the tensions and synergies between the philosophical exploration of existence and the empirical study of human life, it facilitates the development of a more comprehensive understanding of reality. This system-structure allows us to apprehend the unity in the diverse phenomena of existence, forming a coherent worldview that encompasses both the abstract and the concrete, the universal and the particular.
