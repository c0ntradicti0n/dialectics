**Thesis:** System-structure refers to the underlying organization and arrangement of components within a system. It encompasses the relationships, hierarchies, and patterns that define the functioning of a system. Understanding the system-structure is essential for comprehending how the various elements within a system interact and contribute to its overall behavior.

**Antithesis:** However, a system's structure is not a rigid and fixed entity. Systems and their structures are subject to change, adaptation, and evolution. Just as the components within a system can influence its structure, the structure itself shapes the behavior and characteristics of the system. The dynamic nature of systems necessitates a flexible approach to studying their structures.

**Synthesis:** The synthesis of system-structure is found in the concept of transcendence-of-limit. Transcendence-of-limit recognizes that systems and their structures are not confined by predefined boundaries or restrictions. Instead, systems have the capability to exceed their perceived limits and evolve beyond their current state. This concept acknowledges the potential for growth, adaptation, and innovation within system structures.

**Antinomic Mutual Relation:** The antinomic mutual relation within the synthesis of transcendence-of-limit and system-structure is the "finite-infinite." While system structures have finite boundaries and capacities, they also have the capacity to extend into the infinite through transcendence and expansion. The interplay between the finite and the infinite within system structures represents the continuous strive for improvement, growth, and the search for new possibilities.
