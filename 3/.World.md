The world serves as a synthesis of metaphysics and anthropology, as it encapsulates both the metaphysical principles and the manifestations of human existence. The world, as a dialectical unity of metaphysics and anthropology, comprises both the underlying universal principles and the diverse realities of human societies and cultures. It incorporates both the transcendent elements of metaphysics and the immanent realities of human life, melding them into a single, holistic entity.
