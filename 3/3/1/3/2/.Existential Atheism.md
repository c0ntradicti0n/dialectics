Existential atheism revolves around the belief of lifeâ€™s inherent meaningless, discarding the need for a divine entity or faith to provide purpose or value to human existence. It champions the individual's subjective experience and freedom to create their meaning and values leading to a recognition of the responsibility humans bear for their own actions in the absence of divine moral arbitration.

Famous quote: "I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist." - Albert Camus
