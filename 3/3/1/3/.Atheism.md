Atheism negates the premise of Theism, rejecting the existence of metaphysical beings or divinity. An inherent skepticism toward divine authority, unseen realities, and spiritual realms characterizes atheism. Atheists often ground their outlook in empirical evidence and rationale, where observable facts guide understanding and interpretation. As a counterphilosophy to theism, atheism espouses a worldview centered on human capacity, natural phenomena, and scientific approaches to life's fundamental questions. Where religious worldviews derive moral norms, ethical guidelines, and existential answers from divine revelation, atheists draw these from human wisdom, experience, and observation of the natural world.
