[Atheism negates the](3/3/1/3/.Atheism) premise of Theism, [rejecting the existence](3/3/1/3/2/1/_Existence-Meaninglessness) [of metaphysical beings](3/3/1/_Divine-Mundane) or divinity. An [inherent skepticism toward](3/3/1/3/1/1/.Scientific%20Skepticism) divine authority, unseen realities, and spiritual realms characterizes atheism. [Atheists often ground](3/3/1/3/.Atheism) [their outlook in](2/1/2/3/2/.Pessimism) [empirical evidence and](2/3/1/3/1/1/.Observational%20Evidence) rationale, where observable [facts guide understanding](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) and interpretation. As [a counterphilosophy to](2/3/1/3/3/2/.Unfalsifiable%20Concepts) theism, atheism espouses [a worldview centered](3/3/1/2/.Religious%20Worldviews) on human capacity, natural phenomena, and [scientific approaches to](2/3/1/2/1/.Scientific%20Method) life's fundamental questions. [Where religious worldviews](3/3/1/2/.Religious%20Worldviews) derive moral norms, ethical guidelines, and [existential answers from](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) divine revelation, atheists [draw these from](1/1/3/2/2/1/3/1/.Trial%20and%20Error) human wisdom, experience, [and observation of](2/2/3/3/1/1/.Observation) the natural world.
