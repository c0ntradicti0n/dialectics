Rational atheism embraces human reason and empirical evidence as the sole arbiters of truth, rejecting supernatural entities or divine interventions. It firmly roots itself within the sphere of knowledge obtained through scientific reasoning and intellectual rigor. This faith in the primacy of the human intellect allows for the argument that gods or divine entities are human creations, projections of human concerns, fears, and desires, thus making the divine redundant in understanding the workings of the universe.

Famous quote: "I am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world." - Richard Dawkins
