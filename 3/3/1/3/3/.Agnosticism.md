Agnosticism maintains the position that the existence of God or any divine entity is fundamentally unknowable. It proposes that human reason is incapable of affirming or denying the existence of the divine, thus rendering any claims of certainty about such matters as inherently flawed. The hallmark of agnostic thought lies in its embrace of uncertainty and skeptical inquiry, eschewing definitive claims on metaphysical truths.

Famous quote: "I am an agnostic; I do not pretend to know what many ignorant men are sure of." - Clarence Darrow
