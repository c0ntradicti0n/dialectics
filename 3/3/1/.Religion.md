Religion often emerges as an attempt to connect with, comprehend, or even negotiate with a perceived higher power or powers, encompassing practices, beliefs, moralities, and worldviews.

Whether through rituals, doctrines, or communal gatherings, it brings forth the Divine into the realm of the Mundane, creating a bridge between the ethereal and the tangible.
