Religious Worldviews represent the ideological lens influenced by theism through which an individual or community interprets reality and life's experiences. They provide explanations for life and its existential and metaphysical questions, partaking in a timeless attempt to reconcile the human mind with unobservable realities. The religious worldview can take on numerous forms, as it embraces myriad perspectives, deities, doctrines, rituals, and sacred texts that guide the understanding of life, death, morality, purpose, and destiny. Monotheism and Polytheism may form contrasting religious worldviews, yet they converge on the shared belief in divine authority and its role in shaping theological doctrines and ethical norms. shaping theological doctrines and ethical norms. shaping theological doctrines and ethical norms. shaping theological doctrines and ethical norms. shaping theological doctrines and ethical norms. shaping theological doctrines and ethical norms. shaping theological doctrines and ethical norms. shaping theological doctrines and ethical norms.
