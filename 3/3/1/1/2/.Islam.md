Islam represents the unity of Allah and his Prophet Muhammad into a non-dual framework. It reveres the Quran, embodying the synthesis of divine revelation and human codification. The faith underscores the necessity of submission to God's will, yet grapples with the tension between individual freedom and religious authority.

> "Whoever kills an innocent life it is as if he has killed all humanity." - Quran 5:32
