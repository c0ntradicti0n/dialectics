In essence, Theism signifies the belief in the existence of a divine or supernatural being or entities, often personified as God or gods. This belief grounds itself upon the acceptance of a metaphysical entity, beyond human comprehension and physical properties, governing and influencing the material and spiritual realm. Theism can further diverge into monotheism, the belief in a singular, omnipotent God, and polytheism, the belief in multiple gods, each with specific domains of influence. The human quest for understanding the Creation and the Creator forms the ideological bedrock of Theism, attributing divine attributes and powers to the metaphysical entity.
