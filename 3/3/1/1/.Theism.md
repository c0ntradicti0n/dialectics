In essence, Theism [signifies the belief](2/2/3/3/3/1/.Belief) [in the existence](2/2/3/2/3/1/.Reality%20and%20Existence) [of a divine](3/2/3/3/1/1/1/.Divine%20Right) [or supernatural being](3/3/1/2/3/2/.Shamanism) or entities, often [personified as God](3/3/3/_Manifestation-Transformation) or gods. This [belief grounds itself](2/2/3/3/3/1/.Belief) [upon the acceptance](2/2/1/1/1/3/.Conviction) [of a metaphysical](2/2/3/2/3/.Metaphysics) entity, beyond human [comprehension and physical](1/1/3/2/3/3/3/3/.Physical%20Interpretations) properties, governing and [influencing the material](2/3/3/2/3/_Material-Immaterial) and spiritual realm. [Theism can further](3/3/1/1/.Theism) diverge into monotheism, [the belief in](2/2/3/3/3/1/.Belief) a singular, omnipotent God, and polytheism, [the belief in](2/2/3/3/3/1/.Belief) multiple gods, each [with specific domains](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/2/1/.Integral%20Domains) of influence. The [human quest for](2/3/3/.Human%20Endeavors) [understanding the Creation](3/3/3/1/.Creation%20Myths) [and the Creator](3/3/1/2/2/3/1/.Creation%20Gods) [forms the ideological](3/2/3/3/2/2/1/_Ideology-Electorate) bedrock of Theism, [attributing divine attributes](3/3/1/_Divine-Mundane) [and powers to](1/1/3/2/2/2/1/3/3/.Power) the metaphysical entity.
