Christianity, rooted in monotheism, posits a Trinitarian Godhead - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It emphasizes the self-sacrifice of God's son, Jesus Christ, for human redemption, embodying the synthesis of divine power and human vulnerability. However, Christianity struggles with interpreting the mystery of the Trinity and the problem of suffering in a world governed by a benevolent God.
