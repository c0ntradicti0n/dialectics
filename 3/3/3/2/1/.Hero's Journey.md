The hero's journey, a term coined by Joseph Campbell, refers to a common narrative archetype where a hero embarks on an adventure, faces and overcomes a crisis, and then returns home transformed. It appears in various forms across many cultures and periods, embodying the human experience and spiritual growth. This universal narrative is profoundly ingrained in human consciousness and has been interpreted psychoanalytically as reflecting the individual's journey to self-realization.
