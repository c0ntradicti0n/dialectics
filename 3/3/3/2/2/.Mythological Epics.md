These narratives often mingle the mortal realm with the divine, the human heroes often entwined with gods in their quests. From Homer's "Odyssey" to India's "Mahabharata," these works capture the historical, philosophical, and religious vera of their respective cultures, presenting an anthropological insight into early societies.
