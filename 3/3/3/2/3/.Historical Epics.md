Historical epics, in contrast to mythological epics, are grounded in historical truth or based on historical events, though often embellished to grandiose proportions. These span large periods and delve into the details of the social, political, and cultural conditions of the time. They embody the spirit of the periods they are situated in, preserving history in narrative form, and instilling an understanding of cultural heritage.
