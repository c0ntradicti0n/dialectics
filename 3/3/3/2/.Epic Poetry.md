Epic poetry, as the favored narrative form for many ancient and medieval storytelling traditions, mirrors the vast expanse of human experience, encompassing heroic exploits, morality, and wisdom. Epics, condensing the courage and folly of heroes, the grandeur of vast empires, the loyal companionship of followers, or subtle insights of seers, do not merely tell a story. They embody shared values, ideas, and ideals of a civilization and timeless themes of heroism, valor, love, and betrayal. They transcend the boundaries of time and space, allowing us to explore distant worlds through the exploits of Odysseus, the valor of Beowulf, or the moral struggles of Arjuna.
