Cosmogonic myths are stories about the origin of the universe and everything within it. These myths often entail a process starting from a state of nothingness or chaos that evolves into an ordered universe. The act of creation is usually attributed to a divine entity or entities who impose order upon the initial state of chaos. Cosmogonic myths serve to explain the unexplainable phenomena of existence, providing a comforting sense of order and purpose to the perceivable universe.
