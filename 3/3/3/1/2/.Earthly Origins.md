Earthly origin myths refer to stories centering on the creation and formative events of the Earth and its terrestrial features. These elaborate narratives often involve supernatural beings or forces that shape the Earth. Each culture has its own unique earthly origin myth which explains significant landmarks, geographical features, and the particular environmental realities experienced by that culture. These myths often tie the people closer to the land they inhabit.
