Mythology, serving as a synthesis of both religion and art, narrates profound truths through symbolic tales and characters. Myths blend the structure of religious beliefs with the creativity of artistic narratives. These stories are neither mere figments of imagination nor strictly dogmatic teachings but are allegorical tales holding deep societal, psychological, and cosmic insights. Mythology embodies the transformation of observed realities into manifested tales, providing cultural, moral, and existential guidance.
