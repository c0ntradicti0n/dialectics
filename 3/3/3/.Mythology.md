Mythology, serving as [a synthesis of](1/3/1/2/3/2/1/1/2/2/1/.Synthesis) [both religion and](3/3/1/2/1/1/2/.Christianity) art, narrates profound [truths through symbolic](1/1/3/1/1/2/3/1/.Symbolic) tales and characters. [Myths blend the](3/3/3/1/2/3/.Sky%20Myths) [structure of religious](3/3/1/.Religion) [beliefs with the](2/2/3/3/3/1/.Belief) [creativity of artistic](2/3/1/1/.Art) narratives. These stories [are neither mere](3/3/1/_Divine-Mundane) [figments of imagination](2/1/3/2/1/1/.Imagination) [nor strictly dogmatic](3/3/1/3/3/2/.Strong%20Agnosticism) [teachings but are](3/3/1/3/3/2/1/.Theological%20Noncognitivism) [allegorical tales holding](3/3/3/.Mythology) deep societal, psychological, and cosmic insights. [Mythology embodies the](3/3/3/.Mythology) [transformation of observed](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) [realities into manifested](3/1/1/2/2/_Manifestation-Interpretation) tales, providing cultural, moral, and existential guidance.
