The dialectical interplay between past (before), present (during), and future (after) underlines all prophecies, predictions and forecasts. In grappling with the future, we borrow from the past and operate in the present, constantly oscillating between what has been, what is, and what could be. The "Before-During-After" dialectic underscores the pervasive relationship between time's flow and our continuous attempts to anticipate what lies ahead.
