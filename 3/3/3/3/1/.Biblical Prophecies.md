Biblical prophecies, steeped in faith and divine symbolism, provide a lens into the future as predetermined by a higher will. They drive home the concept of Fatalism, of a predestined history, the shape of which is solely within the hands of the divine. However, the subjective interpretation of symbolism in prophecies leads to a multitude of possible outcomes, painting a picture of a future that's as much malleable as it is predestined.
