Culture, as an embodiment of shared values, beliefs, customs, practices, and artifacts, permeates every aspect of human life. It acts as a lens through which individuals interpret and give meaning to the world around them. Yet, as static as some traditions might seem, culture is a living, evolving entity. The interplay between preserving traditions and adapting to changing circumstances, or even absorbing elements from other cultures, represents the central dialectical tension. The challenge lies in determining what is retained, what is transformed, and at what cost.
