Neo-classical ballet, emerged in the 20th century as a response to the rigid rules of classical ballet. It takes its vocabulary from classical ballet but is generally stripped of detailed narratives and ornate settings. It emphasizes speed, energy, and the athleticism of ballet dancers, often pushing boundaries with high levels of technical virtuosity. Neo-classical ballet usually has more complex groupings and less uniformity than classical ballet. The choreographic signatures tend to be identifiable yet unpredictable.
