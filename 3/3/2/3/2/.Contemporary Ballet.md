Contemporary ballet, emerging in the 20th century, is a genre that juxtaposes the traditional ballet's rigidity with modern dance's freedom. Incorporating techniques from classical ballet and modern dance, it allows more movement that may not adhere to the strict body lines set forth by schools of ballet. The cornerstone of contemporary ballet is the emphasis on narrative, often abstract, allowing exploration of new areas of the human psyche and social issues. Contemporary ballet is characterized by its versatility and innovation.
