Classical ballet, distinguished by the elegant movements and precision of its dancers, was originally developed in the courts of the Italian Renaissance, and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has become a highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary. Most classical ballets are performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging. The narrative is often based on fantasy, such as mythological, biblical, or folkloric stories. Each fluid movement embodies a word in the language of classical ballet.
