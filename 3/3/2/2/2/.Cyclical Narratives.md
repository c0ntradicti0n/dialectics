Cyclical narratives embody a movement that turns back on itself, reprising themes, events, or characters in a recurrent manner. Shedding linearity, these narratives capture the cyclical nature of existence, establishing a continuous loop of action and consequence.

Famous quote: "The road goes ever on and on." - J.R.R. Tolkien
