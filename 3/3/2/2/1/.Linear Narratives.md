Linear narratives unfold in a chronological order, from a clear beginning, progressing through a middle, and finally reaching a resolution at the end. Such narratives possess a direct and predictable trajectory, providing a clear sense of progression and closure.

Famous quote: "People think that stories are shaped by people. In fact, it's the other way around." - Terry Pratchett
