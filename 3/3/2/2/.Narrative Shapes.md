Narratives are essentially structured stories that bring order and meaning to the complex array of human experiences. Every narrative carries a distinctive shape in the form of a plot that structures our engagement with the events, characters, and themes presented in the story. This narrative shape embodies a pattern of change and development. In classic narrative structures, it usually follows a trajectory of tension and resolution, moving from a state of equilibrium, through conflict, climax, and turning point, to a final resolution. In effect, the narrative shape is a conceptual map guiding our emotional and cognitive responses to a story. This shape can be linear or nonlinear, sequential or fragmented, echoing the varied, complex contours of human lives and realities. The narrative shape is a crucial medium of meaning-making, visualizing the underlying pattern in a sequence of events or a set of interconnected dynamics.
