[Narratives are essentially](3/2/1/3/1/2/1/2/.Narrative) [structured stories that](3/3/2/3/2/2/1/.Storytelling) [bring order and](1/1/3/2/1/3/1/1/.Order) [meaning to the](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/2/3/.Meaning%20of%20Words) [complex array of](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/3/2/.Complex%20Coordinates) human experiences. Every [narrative carries a](3/2/1/3/1/2/1/2/.Narrative) [distinctive shape in](3/1/1/2/3/3/2/1/2/.Square%20Shape) [the form of](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/3/1/2/.Differential%20Forms) [a plot that](3/2/1/2/3/2/2/.Plot) [structures our engagement](2/1/2/1/3/_Engagement-Disengagement) with the events, characters, and themes [presented in the](3/2/1/2/2/1/.Presentation) story. This narrative [shape embodies a](3/1/1/2/3/3/2/1/2/.Square%20Shape) [pattern of change](2/2/3/2/3/3/.Change%20and%20Permanence) and development. In classic narrative structures, [it usually follows](2/3/2/2/1/1/_Old%20Order-New%20Order) [a trajectory of](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/2/2/.Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20Voice) tension and resolution, [moving from a](3/3/2/2/2/3/2/.Transformation) state of equilibrium, through conflict, climax, and turning point, [to a final](3/1/3/3/1/2/3/1/3/.Final%20Product) resolution. In effect, [the narrative shape](3/3/2/2/.Narrative%20Shapes) [is a conceptual](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) [map guiding our](1/3/1/1/1/3/3/_North-South) [emotional and cognitive](2/1/3/3/1/3/.Cognitive) [responses to a](3/2/3/3/2/1/2/_Question-Answer) story. This shape [can be linear](1/1/3/2/2/1/2/_Linearity-Nonlinearity) or nonlinear, sequential or fragmented, echoing the varied, complex [contours of human](3/1/1/2/3/3/2/2/2/.Medical%20Image%20Analysis) lives and realities. [The narrative shape](3/3/2/2/.Narrative%20Shapes) [is a crucial](3/1/3/3/1/2/1/2/_Essential-Nonessential) medium of meaning-making, [visualizing the underlying](3/1/3/3/1/2/3/3/3/.Visualization) [pattern in a](1/1/2/3/3/.Pattern) [sequence of events](1/2/2/3/3/1/.Event) [or a set](1/1/3/1/1/3/3/2/1/3/.N-Element%20Set) of interconnected dynamics.
