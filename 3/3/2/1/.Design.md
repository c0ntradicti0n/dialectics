Design is the conscious and purposeful application of creativity to create visual, textual, or interactive artifacts with a specific function or purpose. It implies a process through a sequence of stages, starting from the idea or concept and the formulation of the requirements, to development, visualization, prototyping, and finally, realization and production of the finished artifact. Design, in its essence, is the synthesis of form and function. The purpose or functionality of a design (its utility, ergonomics, efficiency) conbases its form (its appearance, style, aesthetics). A well-designed object or system, whether it be a physical product, a visual image, or a piece of software, reflects a clear understanding and application of these dual aspects of design, achieving a balanced integration of form and function.
