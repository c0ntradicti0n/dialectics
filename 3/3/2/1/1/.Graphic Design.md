Graphic design establishes a visual language communicating ideas and conveying information through a combination of images, typography, and colors. It capitalizes on aesthetics and style to project the desired narrative or message, weaving together text and visual elements to form a cohesive and engaging whole.

Famous quote: "There are three responses to a piece of design â€“ yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for." - Milton Glaser
