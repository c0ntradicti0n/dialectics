Industrial design centers on the creation of products that balance functionality, aesthetics, and economic considerations. It integrates art, science, and technology to improve the usability, appearance, and production cost-efficiency of products, refining them to optimize their user interface, functionality, and overall benefit for consumers.

Famous quote: "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs
