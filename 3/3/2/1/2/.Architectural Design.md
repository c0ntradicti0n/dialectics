Architectural design emphasizes the aesthetic and functional aspects of structures and spaces. It balances the demands of built environment functionality, economic viability, and aesthetic satisfaction, synthesizing form and function to shape the physical context within which human activity occurs.

Famous quote: "Architecture is a visual art and the buildings speak for themselves." - Julia Morgan
