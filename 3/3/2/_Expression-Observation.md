[An artwork or](3/1/1/2/1/1/3/2/1/.Painting) [design is not](1/1/3/3/1/1/3/.Design) [solely a reflection](3/2/1/2/1/2/.Reflection) [of the creator's](3/3/1/2/2/3/1/.Creation%20Gods) [perspective but also](3/3/2/3/2/3/2/.Audience%20Perspective) [a catalyst for](2/3/1/2/2/2/.Breakthroughs) the observer's interpretation. [The expressive attributes](1/1/_Intrinsic-Extrinsic) [of the work—its](1/1/3/2/3/3/3/3/1/.Work%20Done) [formal and aesthetic](2/1/1/1/3/2/_Formal-Casual) properties, semantic contents, [and emotional resonances—are](2/1/2/1/.Emotions) [perceived and processed](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) by the observer, [leading to an](3/3/3/2/1/2/.Crossing%20the%20Threshold) [interpretive reconstruction of](1/1/3/2/3/3/1/2/_Reconstruction-Deconstruction) the work's meaning. This interaction, a [dialectic movement between](1/1/3/3/_Homogeneity-Heterogeneity) expression and observation, [informs a critical](3/2/3/3/2/3/2/_Inform-Influence) [dimension to the](3/2/2/3/1/.Dimensions) [understanding and appreciation](2/2/1/1/3/2/.Understanding) of Art. In essence, a work [of Art is](3/1/1/2/1/1/3/1/.Principle%20of%20Art) a shared construct, [dynamically realized through](3/1/1/3/2/3/_Pre-defined-Dynamic) [the mutual interplay](2/1/1/3/3/.Social%20Interactions) [of creator's expression](2/3/1/1/_Creator-Creation) and observer's observation. [The meaning of](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/2/3/.Meaning%20of%20Words) [the work unfolds](2/1/1/2/2/2/3/3/2/.Labor) [and evolves within](1/1/3/2/1/3/2/.Evolution) [this interactive matrix](1/2/1/2/3/3/.Matrix) [of creation and](3/3/1/2/1/_God-Creation) reception, subjective intention and objective analysis, [personal response and](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/.Communication) collective discourse.
