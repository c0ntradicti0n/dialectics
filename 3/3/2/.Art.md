Art, as a mode of human expression, brings forth inner emotions, ideas, and perceptions into observable forms. Opposing the organized and spiritual structure of religion, art thrives in spontaneity, individualistic interpretation, and abstract reflection. It may not provide answers like religion, but it effectively captures the questions, making them visible, audible, or tangible. Instead of a bridge, art can be seen as a mirror, reflecting both the creator's internal landscape and the viewer's interpretations.
