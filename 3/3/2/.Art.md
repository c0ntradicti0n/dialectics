Art, as a [mode of human](2/3/3/3/1/2/3/.Human%20Behavior) expression, brings forth inner emotions, ideas, [and perceptions into](2/2/2/3/3/_Perception-Judgment) observable forms. Opposing [the organized and](1/1/3/3/1/3/.Organization) [spiritual structure of](1/1/2/3/.Structure) religion, art thrives in spontaneity, individualistic interpretation, and abstract reflection. It may [not provide answers](2/1/1/3/3/3/.Ignoring) like religion, but [it effectively captures](3/1/1/3/3/1/3/.Kinetic%20Harvesting) the questions, making them visible, audible, or tangible. Instead of a bridge, [art can be](2/3/3/1/3/.Art%20Forms) [seen as a](3/3/2/2/1/2/1/.Protagonist) mirror, reflecting both [the creator's internal](2/3/1/1/_Creator-Creation) [landscape and the](3/2/1/2/3/1/1/2/.Landscape) viewer's interpretations.
