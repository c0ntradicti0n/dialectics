Negotiation-of-Meaning is a continuous, dynamic process that occurs whenever individuals or groups come into contact. As people bring with them diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and understandings, the act of communication is rarely about mere information transfer. Instead, it's a complex dance of aligning interpretations, recalibrating assumptions, and refining definitions. This negotiation is evident in all facets of culture, from signification and institutional dynamics to cultural embodiment. By engaging in this process, societies find a way to coalesce diverse meanings, ensuring the continuity and evolution of cultural narratives.
