In each of the previous dialectics—applied science, artistry, and politics—the negotiation of meaning acts as the Inversive Dialectical Antonym. In applied science, it represents the interpretation of theoretical concepts into practical applications. In artistry, it encompasses the translation of an artist’s conceptual vision into physical form. In politics, it signifies the processes by which diverse perspectives and interests are translated into collective decisions and actions. In each case, the negotiation of meaning serves as the pivot that enables the transition from thesis to antithesis and ultimately to synthesis.
