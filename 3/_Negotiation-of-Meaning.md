[Negotiation-of-Meaning is a](3/_Negotiation-of-Meaning) continuous, dynamic process [that occurs whenever](1/2/2/3/3/1/.Event) [individuals or groups](3/2/2/1/1/2/_Individual-Group) come into contact. [As people bring](1/1/3/3/2/3/1/.Gathering) [with them diverse](3/2/3/3/2/3/3/.Multiculturalism) backgrounds, perspectives, and understandings, the act [of communication is](3/1/1/2/1/1/2/.Communication) [rarely about mere](3/3/2/1/3/3/1/.Minimalistic) information transfer. Instead, [it's a complex](3/3/3/1/1/1/_Simple-Complex) [dance of aligning](3/3/3/3/2/2/_Alignment-Shift) interpretations, recalibrating assumptions, and refining definitions. [This negotiation is](3/2/3/1/3/3/1/_Representation-Negotiation) [evident in all](1/2/1/1/3/.Everywhere) facets of culture, [from signification and](3/1/1/2/1/1/_Signifier-Signified) [institutional dynamics to](3/2/.Institutional%20Structures) cultural embodiment. By [engaging in this](2/1/1/3/3/2/1/.Watching) process, societies find [a way to](1/2/3/1/_Step%20by%20Step) coalesce diverse meanings, [ensuring the continuity](1/1/3/1/1/3/2/1/2/3/.Continuous%20Functions) [and evolution of](1/1/3/2/1/3/2/.Evolution) cultural narratives.
