States and their interstate relationships constitute the backbone of international politics. Each sovereign state operates within defined borders, guided by their governmental structure, ruling ideologies, and national interests. Interstate relations then revolve around cooperation, conflict, negotiation, and diplomacy between these independent entities, shaping the global political landscape. Challenges frequently arise from disparities in power, sovereignty issues, and differing ideologies, often leading to complex international scenarios.
