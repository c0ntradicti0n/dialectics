Ochlocratia, or mob rule, is a degenerate form of democracy where political authority resides in the tyranny of the majority. The majority, swayed by demagogues or passions of the moment, could enforce their will without considering minorities' rights, thereby negating the principle of balancing rights central to a democratic or republican system.
