International Law navigates the realm of state interactions, setting the rules of the international playing field. Beyond state interactions, international law instills a sense of normative order in international relationships, addressing issues of war, diplomacy, and economic relations. The solidity of law is pinned against the fluidity of global politics, revealing the tension between state sovereignty, international cooperation, and global justice.

"The real rulers in Washington are invisible, and exercise power from behind the scenes." - Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter
