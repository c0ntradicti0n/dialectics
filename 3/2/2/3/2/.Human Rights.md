Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms to which all individuals are entitled, universally and invariantly, irrespective of nationality, sex, ethnicity, religion, or any other discriminatory factor. The concept of human rights affirms the fundamental dignity and equality of all human beings. Covering a wide spectrum, these rights span from the right to life, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of thought and expression, and the right to work and receive an education. Human rights are safeguarded and upheld by international and national laws and treaties.
