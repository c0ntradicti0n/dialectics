The term 'dimensions' essentially refers to the fundamental aspects of reality. It denotes measures or coordinates which are necessary to orient and differentiate the constituents of the universe. The dimensions, such as the three perceptible spatial dimensions and the fourth of time, give order, allowing us to grasp events and objects in spacetime locality. In the domain of human perception, the dimensions ordinarily referred to are spatial dimensions: length, width, and height. Science, however, unravels the concept that the universe operates with more than just the observable dimension.
