Civil Law, dealing with private disputes, serves as an instrument for adjudicating conflicts over obligations arising from contracts, torts, and property rights. It champions the protection and enforcement of individual rights, providing redress for personal injuries, breaches of contract, and property disputes. Within it, echoes the call for justice, equity, and restitution.

"In this country, it is a good thing to kill an admiral from time to time to encourage the others." - Voltaire
