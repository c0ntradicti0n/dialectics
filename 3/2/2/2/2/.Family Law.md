Family law governs the legal responsibilities and rights of individuals within a familial relationship, including marriage, divorce, and child custody. It mediates familial conflicts, strives to protect vulnerable parties, and upholds the legalities of marital and familial ties. In the realm of law, it touches upon the most intimate aspects of human relations.
