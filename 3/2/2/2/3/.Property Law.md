Property law administers various kinds of ownership and tenancy both in real property and personal property. Whether it's intellectual property rights, land and estate ownership, or asset management, these laws help manage the societal balance between protective boundaries of individual claims and communal harmony. As Cicero observed, "We are all servants of the laws in order to be free."
