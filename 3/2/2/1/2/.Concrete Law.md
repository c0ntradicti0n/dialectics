Concrete law refers to individual statutes, regulations, and court rulings that are explicitly codified and enforced within our legal systems to ensure specific societal conduct. It can include anything from traffic laws, narcotic regulations to privacy protection measures and hate-speech interdictions. These laws are context-dependent, changing with societal norms and continuous reinterpretations.
