Criminal Law, the embodiment of public morality, exists to regulate social behavior through the prism of legal norms. The provisions of criminal law seek to uphold societal values, prevent harm, and punish wrongdoers. Yet, in defining and enforcing these norms, it grapples with intricate questions of freedom, responsibility, and the limits of punitive power.

"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury..." - Fifth Amendment, U.S. Constitution
