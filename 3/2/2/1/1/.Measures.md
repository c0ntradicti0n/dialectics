In the context of criminal law, measures refer to the legislative tools, practices, obligations, and restrictions tasked with upholding law and order. These include various penalties and sentences, probation regulations, rehabilitation efforts, and preventive laws, used to counteract the deeds that disturb societal harmony. As Justice Potter Stewart said, "Fairness is what justice really is."
