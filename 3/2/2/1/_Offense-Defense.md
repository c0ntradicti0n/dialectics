In criminal law, the interplay of offense and defense forms a dialectic process that contributes to the maintenance of justice. Offenses signify all the acts that violate the established laws, while defenses represent the legal rights and arguments used to contest or mitigate these violations. It underlines the dialectic conflict between securing the rights of the individual while protecting societal interests.
