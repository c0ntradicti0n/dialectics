Legal foundations are the fundamental underpinnings that guide the formation, interpretation, and application of law. This primarily includes constitutions, legal codes, and case precedents, which serve as a socio-legal contract fostering societal cohesion. As Aristotle said, "At his best, a man is the noblest of all animals; separate from law and justice, he is the worst."
