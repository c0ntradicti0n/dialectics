Democracy is a political system where power is vested in the people who govern either directly or through elected representatives. Citizen participation, equal voting rights, and majority rule are its core premises. However, unchecked democracy can metamorphose into its antithesis, turning from a system ruled by the many to a system susceptible to ochlocracy, the rule of the mob.
