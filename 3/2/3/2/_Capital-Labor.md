Capital and labor encompass the core elements of the economic production process. Capital represents all non-human assets used in production, such as machinery and buildings, while labor refers to the human input necessary for production. Each has a critical role in economic production and wealth creation. The relations between capital and labor have been a central question in political economy, particularly in the scope of wage labor issues, worker rights, and the appropriate distribution of economic output.
