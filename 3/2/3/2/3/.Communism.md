Communism is a radical form of socialism where all means of production are owned collectively, aiming to establish a classless society with common ownership of property. In theory, communism seeks to eliminate social and economic inequalities by abolishing private property and promoting common ownership of all resources. This abolition of private property, it is argued, would eradicate the existing disparities between the rich and the poor, leading to a harmonious and equal society.
