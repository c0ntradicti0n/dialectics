Socio-economics focuses on the relationship between the society and the economy, analyzing how social and economic structures interact and influence one another. It emphasizes the role of social relationships and institutions in the economic activity, increasing the understanding of economic behavior by incorporating social factors. Socio-economics is essentially about the study of how social factors can influence labor, capital, and their interaction. It includes the fields of social policy, public finance and the influence of social values on economic development. The conflicts within socio-economics arise from the inherent tension between the objectives of economic efficiency and social equality.
