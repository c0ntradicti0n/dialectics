Socialism, as mentioned above, is an economic and political system where the community, rather than private entities, owns the means of production. It aims to benefit society at large rather than the select few and create a more equal distribution of wealth. According to socialism, the wealth and resources of a country should be utilized in a way that benefits all citizens, eliminating the exploitative nature of free-market capitalism.
