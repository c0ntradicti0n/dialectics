Capitalism is an economic system where the means of production—like factories, natural resources, and labor—are owned and controlled by private individuals or corporations. Capitalist economies operate on a free market model, determining the production, distribution, and prices of goods and services through the laws of supply and demand. Arguably, it emphasizes individual initiative and promotes competition, fostering innovation and economic growth. It does, however, lead to unequal distributions of wealth.
