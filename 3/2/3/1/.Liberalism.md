Liberalism champions the rights of the individual and the absence of authority — both religious and state— over personal affairs. Favoring liberty over authority, it advocates liberties as principal values including religious freedom, freedom of speech, property rights, and free markets. The concept is commonly viewed as a political ideology that stands for a limited government with respect to individual liberties, as well as a balanced and fair judicial system. However, within liberalism, there's a constant struggle to reach the equilibrium point between individual rights and social liberties.
