Rights are societal norms or laws that protect the freedom of individuals to act or abstain from certain acts, whereas liberties are the absence of arbitrary restrictions on the lives of individuals. Together, these concepts constitute the socio-political fabric of a democratic society. Both concepts advocate for an environment where individuals can coexist harmoniously, enjoying their lives without infringement from others.
