Socialism is a socio-economic system where ownership of resources and the means of production belong to the community as a whole rather than individuals or corporations. Its core belief is that wealth and power should be shared equally among the populace, promoting equal opportunities and a more egalitarian distribution of wealth. Different socialist systems maintain varying levels of market activity. Whether through state ownership or worker cooperatives, however, the goal remains to prioritize social welfare over personal or corporate profit.
