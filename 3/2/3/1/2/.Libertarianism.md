Libertarianism advocates for a substantial reduction in government intervention and a strong emphasis on individual liberty. Libertarians argue for a laissez-faire political and economic system where individuals are free to do as they wish, provided they do not infringe on the same liberties of others. Key tenets include freedom of choice, voluntary association, individual judgment, and self-ownership. It fundamentally argues that free markets, free trade, and private property rights foster creativity, productivity, and social harmony.
