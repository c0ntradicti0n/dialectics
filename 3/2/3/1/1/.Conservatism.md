Conservatism is a socio-political philosophy advocating for the maintenance of established traditions and institutions within the context of culture and civilization. Its underlying principles endorse gradual change and caution against hasty reform measures. Often associated with right-wing politics, conservatism values the preservation of the status quo and often opposes radical changes, emphasizing stability, continuity, and organically formed social structures.
