Political theories provide a comprehensive perspective on how political power is used and justified. They can be as broad as Marxism, with its emphasis on the oppressive role of the capitalist state, and liberalism's focus on individual rights, or as specialized as political game theory, with its analysis of strategic interactions. Political theories often look for an ideal state of affairs, a "utopia," while also diagnosing the problems of current political systems. This concept is beset with contradictions of different ideologies clashing over what is considered ideal or utopian.
