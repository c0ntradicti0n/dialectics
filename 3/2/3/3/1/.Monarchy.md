Monarchy represents absolute sovereignty vested in a single figure, symbolizing the state's identity and unity. The monarch governs by divine right, embodying an indivisible synthesis of power and tradition, though subtly evolving in response to changing circumstances. However, monarchy's structure, with its centralized power, can potentially incubate despotism.

> "The state is not an association of serving and master, but on the contrary the master who is more a master for being more a servant." - Hegel
