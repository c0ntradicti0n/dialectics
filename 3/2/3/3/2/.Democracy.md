Democracy, as the antithesis to monarchy, endorses collective sovereignty based on the majority rule principle. The authority is vested in the people, who actively participate in policy-making directly or through elected representatives. However, democracies run the risk of majority tyranny and instability due to shifting popular opinions.

> "Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary." - Reinhold Niebuhr
