Teaching methods can be seen as the dialectical interplay between prescription and exploration. Prescription seeks structure, offering a well-defined pathway of knowledge, in the form of clear goals, and incremental modules. It excels in efficiency and consistency. Exploration on the other hand, promotes the messy process of discovery, where students learn problem-solving skills and creativity by navigating uncharted territories of knowledge. The dialectic of these two methods creates a dynamic balance between guidance and autonomy, fostering an optimized environment for learning.
