The Lecture method is the instructional technique that consists of the delivery of information by a teacher to a student. It is the traditional method of teaching that has been utilized for centuries across cultures. It stands in antithesis to Experiential Learning by emphasizing the acquisition of knowledge through passive reception rather than active implementation.
