Experiential Learning involves learning through reflection on doing, which immediately associates it with the practical aspect of learning. This approach emphasizes the value of both learning and applying that acquirement in a contextual setting. It substantiates the theory that humans learn most effectively when they can apply the knowledge gained in real-world situations. As Aristotle once opined, "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them."
