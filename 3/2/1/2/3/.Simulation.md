Simulation forms the synthesis between Experiential Learning and the Lecture method. A Simulation is an imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. They merge the advantages of both, providing a medium for active engagement within a controlled, replicable environment, enabling the dynamic application of knowledge.
