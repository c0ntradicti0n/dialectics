Visual represents one of the primary modes of perception and communication for humans, with vision being the dominant sensory system. Utilizing our eyes, we convert light waves into mental images, allowing us to interpret and interact with our surroundings. From observing patterns in nature to deciphering complex visual data and graphics, the visual objects and experiences play an essential role in our cognitive development and understanding of our world.
