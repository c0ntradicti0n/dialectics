Kinesthetic refers to our sense of body movements and physical interactions, including touch, gesture, and motion. This tactile sensory system allows us to navigate and manipulate our environment through direct physical experience. Whether we're crafting a hand-made item, dancing, or engaging in sports, our kinesthetic abilities underpin our dexterity and bodily expression.
