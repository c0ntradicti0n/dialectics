[Learning styles represent](3/2/1/3/.Learning%20Styles) [the dialectics between](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) [sensory and abstract](2/1/3/2/3/_Sensation-Cognition) engagement. Sensory engagement [refers to experiential](3/2/1/2/1/.Experiential%20Learning) [learning that involves](3/2/1/1/.Learning%20Process) our five senses, [serving as a](3/3/2/3/2/3/_Performer-Observer) [direct and immediate](3/1/1/1/3/1/_Direct-Indirect) [interface between the](3/1/1/3/1/_Hardware-Software%20Interface) [learner and the](3/2/1/1/.Learning%20Process) external world. Abstract [engagement encompasses cognitive](2/1/2/1/3/_Engagement-Disengagement) [operations of thinking](2/1/3/2/1/.Thought) and reflection, facilitating [the construction of](2/1/1/3/2/2/2/.Built%20Structures) [conceptual and theoretical](2/1/3/2/2/2/2/.Concept) understanding. The synthesis [of sensory and](2/1/3/2/3/_Sensation-Cognition) [abstract engagement caters](2/1/2/1/3/_Engagement-Disengagement) [to individual learning](3/2/1/1/.Learning%20Process) [strengths that differ](1/3/1/2/3/1/1/1/.Strength) amongst learners, ensuring [inclusivity and diversity](3/2/3/1/3/2/3/_Equity-Disparity) in learning approaches.
