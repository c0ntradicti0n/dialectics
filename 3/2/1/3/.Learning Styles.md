Learning styles represent the dialectics between sensory and abstract engagement. Sensory engagement refers to experiential learning that involves our five senses, serving as a direct and immediate interface between the learner and the external world. Abstract engagement encompasses cognitive operations of thinking and reflection, facilitating the construction of conceptual and theoretical understanding. The synthesis of sensory and abstract engagement caters to individual learning strengths that differ amongst learners, ensuring inclusivity and diversity in learning approaches.
