Our capacity for integrating visual and auditory stimuli into meaningful observations grants us a multi-sensory experience and comprehension of reality. Visual-Auditory interactions are fundamental in many aspects of human life, including language learning, multimedia entertainment, and even spatial navigation. A textual written word (visual) combined with its phonetic sound (auditory), for example, provides a more affluent educational experience, emphasizing this synesthetic relationship.
