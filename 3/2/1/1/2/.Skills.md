Skills signify the antithesis of mere knowledge. They represent the practical application of knowledge that comes from investigation. Skills, whether cognitive or physical, are learned capabilities that allow an individual to complete a task or activity effectively. These competencies are developed through training, experience, and practice over time. As Pele rightly said, "Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do."
