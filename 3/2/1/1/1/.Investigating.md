Investigation as a learning process derives from the human instinct to question and seek understanding. It is through investigation that curiosity is satisfied, theories are developed, understanding is deepened, and knowledge is refined. John Dewey once said, "Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination." Investigation stimulates this audacity of imagination, forming the cornerstone of any learning process.
