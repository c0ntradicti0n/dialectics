In the context of education, Theory and Practice are mutually constitutive. The former provides a general framework and guiding principles derived from thoughtful observation and systematic reasoning. The latter involves the actual implementation or application of theory in real-life scenarios. Education is constantly evolving based on the contradictions that arise between theory and practice, developing richer theories that align closer to practice and practices that better incorporate theoretical knowledge. Vigorous interactions between theory and practice ensures cycles of learning that remain deeply connected to the realities of life and work.
