[In the context](3/1/1/2/3/2/1/2/_Meaning-Context) of education, Theory [and Practice are](3/1/3/3/1/1/2/2/.Skills) mutually constitutive. The [former provides a](3/3/3/3/2/2/1/2/.Inferior%20Conjunction) [general framework and](3/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/.Frameworks) [guiding principles derived](2/2/3/3/2/3/.Principles) [from thoughtful observation](2/2/3/3/1/1/.Observation) and systematic reasoning. [The latter involves](2/2/3/2/2/2/.Understanding%20and%20Explanation) [the actual implementation](3/2/1/1/3/.Implementation) [or application of](2/3/1/2/1/1/.Formulation) [theory in real-life](3/2/1/_Theory-Practice) scenarios. Education is [constantly evolving based](1/3/1/3/2/_Static-Evolution) [on the contradictions](2/2/2/3/1/1/_Implication-Contradiction) [that arise between](2/2/2/1/3/3/3/_Concordance-Discordance) theory and practice, [developing richer theories](2/3/1/3/2/3/.Complexity%20Theories) [that align closer](3/3/3/3/2/2/_Alignment-Shift) [to practice and](3/1/3/3/3/1/1/2/2/.Education) [practices that better](2/3/2/1/2/.Practices) incorporate theoretical knowledge. [Vigorous interactions between](1/3/1/2/1/1/2/3/.Interactions) [theory and practice](3/2/1/_Theory-Practice) [ensures cycles of](3/3/3/3/2/1/_Cycle-Renewal) [learning that remain](3/2/1/1/.Learning%20Process) [deeply connected to](1/1/3/1/2/3/3/.Interconnectedness) [the realities of](2/1/2/3/1/3/.Realism) life and work.
