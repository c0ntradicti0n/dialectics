Signification refers to the process through which meaning is attributed to symbols, words, or gestures within a particular cultural or social context. It delves deep into the layers of communication, unveiling how abstract symbols can represent specific realities or concepts. The interplay of the signifier (the physical form of the sign) and the signified (the concept it represents) is crucial here. Yet, this relation is not always straightforward. The act of signification is often influenced by cultural norms, historical context, and individual interpretations, causing the meaning of a sign to be fluid and ever-changing.
