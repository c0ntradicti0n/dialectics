White hat refers to individuals who use their skills in technology to protect systems and data, often from black hat hackers. Their goals are to improve system security, often by identifying vulnerabilities and then working to patch them. They are seen as ethical hackers.

"Hacker is just a term. It is not synonymous with criminal." - Kevin Mitnick
