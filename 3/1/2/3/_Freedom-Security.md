In the context of systems security, freedom denotes the ease of access and ability to utilize and make changes to a system, while security represents the concept of protecting a system from unauthorized accesses and changes. A perfectly secure system is completely inaccessible, which renders it unusable, while an utterly free system is entirely open to all potential threats. Striking a balance is necessary to ensure optimum operability along with the desired level of security.

"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." - Benjamin Franklin
