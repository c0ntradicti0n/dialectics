The term grey hat is used to describe individuals who fall somewhere in between white and black hat hackers. Grey hats are hackers who may sometimes act legally, other times not. Instilled with a sense of curiosity, they may hunt for vulnerabilities without the owner's approval but usually will disclose the vulnerabilities they discover.

"There is no black-and-white situation. It's all part of life. Highs, lows, middles." - Van Morrison
