**Thesis:** Music theory is the study of the principles and rules that govern the structure, composition, and performance of music. It provides a framework for understanding how musical elements such as melody, harmony, rhythm, and form interact to create expressive and meaningful musical compositions. Music theory enables musicians to analyze and interpret music, facilitating communication and appreciation of this art form.

**Antithesis:** However, music theory alone cannot capture the full essence and experience of music. Music is not limited to a set of theoretical principles but extends beyond that to encompass emotions, personal expression, and cultural contexts. The subjective interpretation and subjective response to music are integral to its appreciation.

**Synthesis:** The synthesis of music theory and subjectivity is found in the concept of improvisation. Improvisation allows for spontaneous musical creation, enabling musicians to express their individuality and respond in the moment. While improvisation may deviate from strict theoretical principles, it adds a unique and personal touch to music, enriching the overall experience.

**Antinomic Mutual Relation:** The antinomic mutual relation within the synthesis of improvisation and music theory is "improvisation-composition." Improvisation and composition represent two different creative approaches in music. Improvisation emphasizes spontaneity and immediate expression, while composition involves deliberate planning and structure. Yet, these two approaches are not completely separate but interact with and enrich each other. Improvisation can inspire new ideas for composition, and compositional techniques can enhance improvisation.
