The thread linking tools & techniques, exploits & sabotage, and ethics is the unintended-intended usage of technology. Technology, in essence, is neutral; its impacts are determined up by how humans choose to use it. While its intended usage in the case of cybersecurity is to provide reliable, secure, and efficient services, the unintended usage includes the tools and techniques hackers employ to exploit these very systems. However, this unintended usage also informs and drives the system's continual improvement and hardening. In a way, the underlying tension between the unintended and intended usage of technology fosters a cybersecurity arms race, leading to more resilient systems. Thus, as alarming and disruptive as hacking may be, it undeniably plays a crucial role in refining the technological landscape.
