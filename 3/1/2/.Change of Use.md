Hacking, conventionally seen [as the act](3/2/1/1/3/_Plan-Act) [of unauthorized intrusion](3/1/2/3/2/3/.Unauthorized%20access) [or manipulation of](3/1/2/1/1/_Direct-Manipulation) systems, reflects a [deeper dialectical tension](1/1/2/1/.Existential%20Dialectics) [between intended and](2/1/1/1/3/3/.Purpose) unintended usages. Historically, [hacking was perceived](3/1/2/.Change%20of%20Use) negatively, a breach of intended purpose. However, its modern interpretation can vary; [from a means](1/1/3/3/1/3/3/.Approach) [to discover vulnerabilities](3/1/2/3/3/1/1/.Vulnerability%20scanning) and strengthen security, [to a form](1/2/3/1/_Step%20by%20Step) [of digital activism](3/1/2/3/3/2/3/.Digital%20protest) [or simply a](3/3/2/2/1/2/1/.Protagonist) [passion-driven endeavor to](2/3/3/.Human%20Endeavors) [understand systems in](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) depth. This continuous [tension between the](3/1/1/1/1/1/2/1/2/_Tension-Release) [intended purpose of](2/1/1/1/3/3/.Purpose) [a system and](1/1/3/3/1/3/1/.System) its unintended, often innovative, exploitation underscores [the antithetical nature](3/3/1/_Divine-Mundane) of hacking.
