Hardware refers to the physical components of a technological system, such as computers, servers, network devices, and so on. Control over hardware carries significant implications in a digital context since it often determines who has access to the software and data. This control can be achieved through physical possession or through some remote mechanism. Understanding hardware is a foundational aspect of understanding a system's vulnerabilities and its protection since it is physical and, therefore, somewhat tangible. It can be locked away, hidden, or destroyed - but it can also be stolen, tampered with, or physically damaged.
