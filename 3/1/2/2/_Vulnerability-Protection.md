Vulnerability refers to a flaw or weakness that can potentially be exploited by a malicious actor to breach a system's security. Vulnerability can be present in both hardware and software aspects, and increasingly, in the social aspects of systems. On the other hand, protection refers to the ability to defend against or prevent exploitations of such vulnerabilities. Understanding the balance and interplay between Vulnerability and Protection is crucial to overall systems security.
