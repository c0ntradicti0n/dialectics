Software implies the sets of instructions that direct the hardware to perform tasks. These instructions can be relatively simple, such as directing data to be transferred from one location to another, to highly complex, such as orchestrating the operations of an entire system. An understanding of software is crucial in systems security as it is typically through software that systems are compromised. Unlike hardware, software exists in a sort of 'conceptual' space, and as such, it presents unique challenges and opportunities for both vulnerability and protection. 

"Software is like entropy: It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it always increases." - Norman Augustine
