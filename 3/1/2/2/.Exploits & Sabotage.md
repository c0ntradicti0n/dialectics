Exploits and sabotage are two sides of the hacking coin. Exploits refer to the identification and utilization of vulnerabilities or weaknesses in systems to gain unauthorized access or control. Hackers exploit flaws in software, hardware, or network configurations to breach security barriers or manipulate functionalities. On the other hand, sabotage involves intentional actions aimed at disrupting, damaging, or disabling systems or infrastructure. Sabotage can take various forms, including network attacks, data breaches, or the introduction of malicious code, all with the intention of causing harm or chaos.
