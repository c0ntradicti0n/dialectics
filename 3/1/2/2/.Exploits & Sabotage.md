Just as a locksmith can maliciously use his tools, hackers can utilize their skills for exploits and sabotage. Exploits are attacks that take advantage of weaknesses, usually software bugs or design flaws, in an application or a system. These exploits can lead to unauthorized access, information stealing, or even system control. Sabotage, on the other hand, is often a step further, where the intention is not just exploitation but inflicting damage. It could range from defacing a website, disabling crucial services, to implementing ransomware attacks for personal gain. While these acts are inherently malicious and ethically questionable, they give birth to an indirect symbiotic relationship between cybercriminals and cyber-defenders as they precipitate the discovery of vulnerabilities needing rectification. questionable, they give birth to an indirect symbiotic relationship between cybercriminals and cyber-defenders as they precipitate the discovery of vulnerabilities needing rectification. questionable, they give birth to an indirect symbiotic relationship between cybercriminals and cyber-defenders as they precipitate the discovery of vulnerabilities needing rectification. questionable, they give birth to an indirect symbiotic relationship between cybercriminals and cyber-defenders as they precipitate the discovery of vulnerabilities needing rectification. questionable, they give birth to an indirect symbiotic relationship between cybercriminals and cyber-defenders as they precipitate the discovery of vulnerabilities needing rectification. questionable, they give birth to an indirect symbiotic relationship between cybercriminals and cyber-defenders as they precipitate the discovery of vulnerabilities needing rectification. questionable, they give birth to an indirect symbiotic relationship between cybercriminals and cyber-defenders as they precipitate the discovery of vulnerabilities needing rectification. questionable, they give birth to an indirect symbiotic relationship between cybercriminals and cyber-defenders as they precipitate the discovery of vulnerabilities needing rectification.
