[Just as a](3/3/2/2/1/2/1/.Protagonist) [locksmith can maliciously](3/1/2/1/1/1/.Lock%20picks) use his tools, [hackers can utilize](3/1/2/.Change%20of%20Use) [their skills for](3/1/3/3/1/1/2/2/.Skills) exploits and sabotage. [Exploits are attacks](3/1/2/2/.Exploits%20&%20Sabotage) [that take advantage](2/2/1/3/2/2/.Exploitation) of weaknesses, usually [software bugs or](3/1/2/2/2/_Bug-Feature) design flaws, in [an application or](1/1/3/2/3/3/3/.Applications) a system. These [exploits can lead](3/1/2/2/.Exploits%20&%20Sabotage) to unauthorized access, information stealing, or even system control. Sabotage, on the other hand, is [often a step](3/3/2/3/3/2/1/.Contemporary%20Steps) further, where the [intention is not](3/1/1/_Intention-Product) [just exploitation but](2/2/1/3/2/2/.Exploitation) inflicting damage. It [could range from](3/3/2/3/1/1/.Basic%20Positions) defacing a website, disabling crucial services, [to implementing ransomware](3/1/2/2/2/2/1/.Encrypting%20ransomware) [attacks for personal](3/1/2/3/2/2/3/.Insider%20threats) gain. While these [acts are inherently](3/1/2/3/3/2/.Anonymous%20actions) [malicious and ethically](2/2/1/3/1/2/.Ethical) questionable, they give [birth to an](2/1/1/2/2/2/1/2/3/.Birth) [indirect symbiotic relationship](1/3/2/2/2/_Symbiotic-Parasitic%20Relationship) [between cybercriminals and](3/1/3/1/3/2/2/.Cybersecurity) [cyber-defenders as they](3/1/3/1/3/2/2/.Cybersecurity) [precipitate the discovery](2/3/1/1/1/_Discovery-Invention) [of vulnerabilities needing](3/1/2/1/3/2/1/.Device%20vulnerabilities) rectification.
