Hacking involves the exploration and manipulation of systems, whether it's a computer network, a software application, or even a physical device. This process requires the use of specific tools and techniques to gain unauthorized access, analyze vulnerabilities, or modify existing functionalities. These tools can range from software applications designed for penetration testing to hardware devices used for reverse engineering. Techniques employed by hackers include coding exploits, social engineering, or data analysis to exploit weaknesses in systems and achieve their objectives.
