Hackers utilize a variety of tools and techniques peculiar to their domain. These tools are not inherently malevolent but facilitate the systematic probing of systems for potential weaknesses, the understanding of these systems at a granular level, and the exploration of new possibilities. Analogous to a locksmith owning lock picks, these tools and techniques are essential for penetration testing and fortification against potential vulnerabilities. Tools range from simple command-line scripts to sophisticated software suites, targeting various aspects like network security, data encryption, and password cracking. Techniques often revolve around exploiting little-known design flaws and oversights within software and systems. This understanding of tools & techniques signifies a domain expertise and an unconventional approach towards solving problems, often needed to find security loopholes hiding in plain sight.
