Applied Science refers to the practical utilization of scientific knowledge for solving specific problems or achieving particular goals. It is a systematic endeavor that builds on theoretical science to develop technologies, methodologies, or techniques that have specific, often immediate, practical applications. The process within applied science encompasses the transformation of abstract scientific concepts into tangible solutions, and in this process, it embodies a transition from theoretical understanding (thesis) to practical application (antithesis), resulting in innovative solutions (synthesis).
