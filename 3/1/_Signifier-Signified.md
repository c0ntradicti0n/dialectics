Signifier-signified is a fundamental concept in semiotics, which explores the relationship between symbols and their meanings. The signifier refers to the physical form or representation of a symbol, such as a word, sound, image, or gesture. It is the material or perceptual aspect that conveys meaning. The signified, on the other hand, represents the concept, idea, or meaning associated with the signifier. The signified is the mental or abstract representation that is invoked or understood when encountering the signifier. The relationship between the signifier and the signified is arbitrary, meaning that different signifiers can be used to represent the same signified. This relationship forms the basis of communication and understanding within language and other symbolic systems.
