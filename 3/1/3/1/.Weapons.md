Weapons signify the literal tools of war, merging technology and strategy in the pursuit of victory. The dialectic of weapon involves the play between assault and defense, offering a unique give-and-take in the context of combat. Whether the focus is on the blade's edge or the shield's curve, weapons encapsulate the raw ferocity and grim necessity of warfare.

"Weapons are the tools of fear; a decent man will avoid them except in the direst necessity." - Lao Tzu
