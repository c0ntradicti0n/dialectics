Traditional crafts bear the legacy of a culture - an echo of ancient talents passed through generations. They are a testament to a collective past that combines creativity, skill, utilitarianism, and the constraints of their time. They provide a snapshot of a culture's aesthetic taste and technological capabilities, reflecting not just the nature of physical objects, but also the societal significance behind them, including rites, tradition, and heritage.
