Physical security refers to the physical and tangible aspects of systems security - these can be as simple as locking up hardware in a secure place, or as complex as the defenses against potential physical attacks on a server farm. It is one of the significant aspects of a comprehensive and effective security strategy.

"Security represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it." - Stephen Covey
