In the context of system security, tactics and strategies refer to the specific measures and broad plans (respectively) put into place to ensure the security of a system. These might entail complex algorithms to guard against intrusion, game-theoretic approaches to managing threats, or any number of other methods.

"Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat."- Sun Tzu
