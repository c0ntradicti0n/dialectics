Functional aesthetics refers to the deliberate integration of beauty and utility in the design and creation of objects. It recognizes that functionality does not have to come at the expense of aesthetics, and vice versa. Functional aesthetics seeks to harmonize form and function, elevating the user experience while delivering practical benefits. Designers and artists strive to create objects that are not only visually appealing but also ergonomic, intuitive, and efficient in their intended use.
