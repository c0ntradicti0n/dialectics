Games harness the whimsy and strategy, offering avenues for sport, recreation, and mental training. From chess to poker, games move in sync with their principles – luck and strategy – shaping diverse experiences. Through proactivity, reactivity, wins, losses, skills, and chance, games act as arenas where man's competitive nature, desperate desires, and cognitive abilities converge.

"Games are the most elevated form of investigation." - Albert Einstein
