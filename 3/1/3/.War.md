War signifies a dramatic escalation in the deployment of tools and resources, usually in the context of disputes over the control of resources or territory. It embodies a starkly different set of intentions and objectives compared to ordinary interactions with the environment and other organisms.

> "In war, truth is the first casualty." - Aeschylus
