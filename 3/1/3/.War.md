War, in its broadest sense, is a process of resolve through contested usage. It can pertain to violent conflict between nations or peoples, ideological battles, economic wars, and so forth. As an extreme form of usage, war can dramatically shift cultural norms, alter societal structures, and redefine values on the individual or community level.
