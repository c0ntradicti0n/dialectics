Economy, threading itself through the tapestry of human affairs, treads an intricate balance of resources and demands. As the arbiter of scarcity and abundance, the economy is the pulse of a civilizationâ€™s material needs and wants. It embodies the perpetual cycle of human effort and fulfilment, the struggle for survival, and the quest for a better life.

"Economic growth may one day turn out to be a curse rather than a good, and under no conditions can it either lead into freedom or constitute a proof for its existence." - Hannah Arendt
