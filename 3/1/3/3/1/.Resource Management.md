Resource Management is a strategic and systematic approach to effectively and efficiently allocate an organization's resources throughout its units, divisions, and entities. These resources may include tangible assets like human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and intangible assets like intellectual property. It is centered around the thesis that an organization can optimize its operations by properly organizing its resources, which contrasts with the spontaneous and uninformed distribution of resources.
