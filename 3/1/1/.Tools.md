Tools fundamentally shape the ways in which organisms interact with their environment. They extend and enhance an organism's capabilities, enabling it to modify its environment and access resources more efficiently. Tools encapsulate a broad range of items, from simple implements like sticks used by animals to sophisticated machines developed by humans.

> "Man is a tool-using animal. Without tools, he is nothing. With tools, he is all." - Thomas Carlyle
