Physical tools are tangible implements that aid in performing tasks more efficiently and effectively. They serve as extensions of the human body, enabling it to exert more force, reach further, or perform actions with more precision than would be possible with the body alone.

> "Every tool carries with it the spirit by which it has been created." - Werner Heisenberg
