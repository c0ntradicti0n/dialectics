Controlled tools represent the sophisticated end of the spectrum where we enact our intentions through mediated, automated processes. They illustrate the evolution of influence, from direct manual action to abstract command, reflecting the fluid nature of systems and tools evolution. In this regard, Marshall McLuhan noted, "We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us."
