Specialized tools mark a significant evolution from general tools by catering to very specific, often unique, tasks or procedures. Unlike general tools, they aren't universally applicable, but instead designed for certain industries, trades or activities. This specialization enhances efficiency and productivity significantly, allowing tasks to be performed with precision and accuracy. With rapid advancement in technology, specialized tools are becoming increasingly prevalent and sophisticated, ranging from medical equipment for neurosurgery to the software tools for 3D animation.
