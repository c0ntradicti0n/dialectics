The concept of "inequality-equality" captures the dialectical tension within social structures. It recognizes that societies exhibit varying degrees of inequality and equality, and these two concepts are in constant dialectical interplay. Inequality refers to the unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and social advantages among individuals or groups. Equality, on the other hand, pertains to the idea of fairness, equal access to opportunities, and the absence of discrimination. The dialectical relationship between inequality and equality is crucial in understanding social dynamics and the pursuit of a just and equitable society.
