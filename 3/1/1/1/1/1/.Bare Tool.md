Physical tools, an [extension of the](1/1/3/1/1/3/1/3/1/3/.Field%20Extensions) [human hand and](3/1/3/1/1/1/2/_One-Handed-Two-Handed) mind, are created [from material means](3/1/1/1/1/2/3/.Derived%20Materials) [to perform specific](1/1/3/2/2/1/1/1/.Procedure) tasks. They simplify [mundane and complex](3/3/3/2/1/1/.Ordinary%20World) tasks, making human [life more manageable](2/2/1/2/2/2/.Well-being) and efficient. From [stone age axes](3/1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2/2/.Traditional%20Stoneware) [to the modern](3/3/2/3/3/2/.Modern%20Innovations) computers, these physical [tools have evolved](2/3/3/3/3/1/.Technological%20Advances) [and increased in](1/1/3/2/1/2/2/1/.Increase) [complexity throughout human](2/3/1/3/2/3/.Complexity%20Theories) [history as they](2/3/2/3/3/1/.History) have been crafted, used, and improved by countless generations. [The physical tool](3/1/1/1/.Physical%20Tools) [remains a testament](2/2/1/1/1/3/.Conviction) to human innovation, creativity and intelligence.
