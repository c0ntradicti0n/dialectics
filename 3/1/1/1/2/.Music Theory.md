Music theory is the realm of understanding the abstract principles and structures behind musical sounds. It dives into the intricate relationships between notes, rhythms, and harmonies, forming the backbone of the melodies and tunes that resonate with us. While one can argue that music is the purest form of emotional expression, it also adheres to certain mathematical and structural patterns. These patterns, such as scales, chords, and intervals, form a systematic foundation from which diverse musical pieces arise. Yet, music theory itself is a continuous journey between the established foundational rules and the constant evolution and reinterpretation of these rules, driven by the creative impulses of composers and musicians.
