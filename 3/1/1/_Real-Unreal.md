The antinomic mutual relation between tangible tools and the intangible tasks they perform underscores the real-unreal tension within this dialectical unit. While tools are undoubtedly real, physical entities, their value and significance extend into the intangible realm of human activity and progress, illustrating a navigation between concrete reality and abstract utility. Additionally, the digital revolution presents increasingly 'unreal' tools - software that solves complex problems but lacks a physical, tangible presence, blurring the line between real-unreal even further.
