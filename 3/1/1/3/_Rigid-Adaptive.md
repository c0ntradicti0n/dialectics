Within the robotics spectrum, the tension between rigidity and adaptation steers their evolution. Rigid systems offer high repeatability and precision but lack flexibility, while adaptive systems can react and adjust, sacrificing some degree of precision for flexibility. Successful autark robots manage to synthesize both traits, combining the strength of endurance in rigid system execution with the flexibility of adaptive learning systems.
