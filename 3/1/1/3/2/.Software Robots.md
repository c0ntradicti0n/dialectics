Software Robots, or commonly known as bots, are applications that run automated tasks over the internet. On one hand, there are 'good bots', which perform helpful tasks such as search engine indexing or customer support. Alternatively, there are 'bad bots' that may steal data or disrupt networks. These bots, existing in the ether of cyberspace, operate on signal based logic, making them inherently transient in nature. They signify the ability to automate the digital landscape, paving the way for machine generated content and decision making.
