Autark robots, the epitome of cutting-edge robotics and AI, stand at the intersection of physical and software robots. By integrating AI into a physical entity, these robots exhibit independence and self-sustainability, capable of making decisions and adapting to their environment without human intervention. These robotic entities, whether a self-driving car, a remote logistical drone, or an independently-operating manufacturing machine, represent the crystallized embodiment of 'endurance' within transient systems.
