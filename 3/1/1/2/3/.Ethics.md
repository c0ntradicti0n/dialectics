The connotations of hacking bifurcate sharply along moral lines. Ethical Hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, is hacking performed to discover vulnerabilities and rectify them. Ethical hackers use the same tools and knowledge as malicious actors but under lawful and legitimate circumstances, intending to improve the security and robustness of the systems. On the flip side, unethical or black-hat hacking involves unauthorized breach and exploitation of systems, often for personal gain or to inflict damage. An ethically complex middle ground exists with "grey hat" hackers, who illegally breach systems without malicious intention and then inform the system owners. The elusiveness of intent creates a spectrum of morality, and this tension between the illegality of the action and the morality of the intention forms the crux of hacking ethics.
