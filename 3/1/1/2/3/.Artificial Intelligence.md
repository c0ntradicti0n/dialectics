Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. These processes include the acquisition of information and rules for using the information, reasoning, using the rules to reach approximate or definitive conclusions, and self-correction. In essence, AI allows computers to learn from experience, understand complex content, recognize patterns, and make decisions in a humanlike manner. This emergent intelligence offers the ability or potential ability to be contextual and adaptive, responding to the environment with a course of action that maximizes its chances of success. AI is the next frontier in human and machine interaction, serving as both an extension and mirror of our capacities and limitations.
