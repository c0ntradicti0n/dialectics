Social structures refer to the enduring patterns of social relationships and institutions that shape individuals' lives and interactions. They include systems and organizations such as families, schools, governments, and economic institutions. Social structures provide the framework within which individuals function, influencing their roles, opportunities, and constraints. The study of social structures sheds light on the distribution of power, resources, and social inequalities within society.
