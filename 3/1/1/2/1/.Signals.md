Signals, in the broadest sense, are discrete packets of information. A signal, whether it's a wave of light, a radio wave, a beacon flame, or a human gesturing, transmits a piece of information from one place to another. These singular units of knowledge, traveling across time and space, form the foundational layer of communications. In the digital world, signals are the bread and butter of binary language â€“ the data transferred through electronic, optical, or radio frequencies between devices. Whether analog or digital, they carry the potential power to command and control complex systems if interpreted correctly. correctly. correctly. correctly. correctly. correctly. correctly. correctly.
