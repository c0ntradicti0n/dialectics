Specialized tools are a subset of physical tools that serve a specific purpose within a particular domain or industry. Unlike general-purpose tools, which can be used for multiple applications, specialized tools are designed with a narrow focus to address unique requirements or challenges. These tools often require expert knowledge to operate and are tailored to optimize performance in specific contexts. Examples of specialized tools include surgical instruments used in medical procedures, precision measuring devices for scientific research, or computer hardware designed for advanced data analysis.
