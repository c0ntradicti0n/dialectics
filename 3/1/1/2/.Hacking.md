Hacking, conventionally seen as the act of unauthorized intrusion or manipulation of systems, reflects a deeper dialectical tension between intended and unintended usages. Historically, hacking was perceived negatively, a breach of intended purpose. However, its modern interpretation can vary; from a means to discover vulnerabilities and strengthen security, to a form of digital activism or simply a passion-driven endeavor to understand systems in depth. This continuous tension between the intended purpose of a system and its unintended, often innovative, exploitation underscores the antithetical nature of hacking.
