A computer is a programmable machine that receives input, stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful format. It's a device capable of following a set of operations automatically via programming. Within its electronic structure, signals become bytes, bytes become code and code turns into complex software. It's a symbol of human economic and scientific advancement, acting as a tool and weapon, a creator and destroyer. The computer's ability to perform vast amounts of complex calculations rapidly is a testament to the swiftly accelerating pace of technology. "To err is human, to really foul things up requires a computer."
