Communication, in its essence, transcends mere words. While verbal communication harnesses the power of language, articulating thoughts, emotions, and ideas, non-verbal communication offers a deeper, more intuitive understanding of human interactions. This includes facial expressions, body language, and even the pauses between words. The antinomic mutual relation here is the tension between the said and the unsaid. While words can precisely convey messages, they are also susceptible to misinterpretation and ambiguity. On the other hand, non-verbal cues, though more primal and universally understood, can be subtle and open-ended. True understanding arises from the delicate interplay between verbal precision and non-verbal nuance.
