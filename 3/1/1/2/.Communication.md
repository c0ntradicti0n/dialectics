Communication embodies the essence of transmitting and receiving information, ideas, emotions, and values. At its core, it seeks to bridge the gap between entities, creating shared understanding and fostering relationships. Yet, its simplicity gives way to complexity, as channels of communication, intended or unintended meanings, barriers, and feedback systems intertwine. In this dance of signs and meanings, the dialectical tension between sender and receiver emerges, alongside the content and the medium. Thus, communication, while fundamentally about connection, constantly grapples with potential disconnection and misinterpretation.
